001	Young lady...please don't get sidetracked by these things. You're the descendant of Mayor Edward. You have to think of the future of this country.
002	I'm sorry. But...I feel a little more at peace with those volunteer soldiers there.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0036
003	Tsk. I feel more worried. That red-headed scoundrel can hardly be trusted.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
004	How can you say that...?!
005	Logi is also trying to stop Alvarez's destructive actions! We should be fighting together...
006	This is a matter of pride. Nothing that you should get involved in, young lady.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
007	That scoundrel said he wanted me to lend him my strength, didn't he? Heh. How pathetic.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	Honestly...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
009	The clock tower will come into view soon. Before that, tell me.
010	Tell you what?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
011	About the mystery revolving around the Sacred Stone. You looked like you'd figured something out when Ronnie was talking.
012	You don't miss a thing, do you? I just hope my guess isn't correct.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
013	Are you saying that it's something even more troublesome than the Demons throughout the country going berzerk?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
014	If my guess is correct, Slothstein might very well be...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
015	...The catalyst that will destroy the entire world.
016	The entire world...?! What do you mean?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
017	Don't worry. In the past, it was the Elester family that halted this tragedy.
018	We have you, a descendant of that family, here with us. I'm sure we'll witness some kind of miracle. We'll be able to avoid the worst.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
019	What...?
020	Here it comes into view–our final battlefield...the clock tower.
021	...!
