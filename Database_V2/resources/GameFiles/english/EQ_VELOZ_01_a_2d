001	The same sky... The unchanging view...
002	The cityscape down below also hasn't changed in the slightest. It's almost as if time has stopped.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0005
003	Just as it has for me...ever since that day.
004	Who are you?
005	Whoa?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0012
006	A-a kid? What are you doing here? Are you lost?
007	Oh, are you the new protector of the clock tower?
008	No, I'm...how can I explain it...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
009	Wow! Amazing! This view is so pretty!
010	What? A-ah... It's pretty incredible, isn't it?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0005
011	Ever since he told me about this place...it's been a favorite of mine.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0011
012	Who?
013	No one.
014	Young miss! Where are you?! Young miss?!
015	I'm going to run out of patience! Please, come out! Young miss!!!
016	Huh?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
017	Oh, it's Ethan! Over here, over here!
018	Huff...huff...! S-so this is where you were!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0016
019	You suddenly disappeared. I nearly had a heart attack!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0014
020	I was talking with this man!
021	Hm! Veloz...did you bring the young miss here?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0029
022	N-no, I didn't! You're mistaken!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0012
023	He was sitting here! He said it was his favorite place!
024	Were you sneaking into here again?	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
025	No, well...I was just...remembering things.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0011
026	I see. But rules are rules.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0030
027	Only protectors of the clock tower are allowed inside here.
028	Sorry. By the way, who is this girl?
029	I never heard about you having a daughter.
030	I-idiot! Don't be rude! This is Mayor Edward's daughter, Miss Fiona.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0012
031	Mayor Edward has a daughter?!
032	I'm responsible for her today. Don't do anything rude, okay?
033	Hey, Ethan. Is this man a clock protector?
034	His name is Veloz. He's a mechanical engineer who works in Real Heaven.
035	He is quite talented for his age. Occasionally, we have him inspect the clock tower's mechanics.
036	Flattery won't gain you anything.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0005
037	Hahah. No need to be so modest.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0007
038	Besides, it seems like we'll have more opportunities to offer you work in the future.
039	Work?
040	Right now, we're testing out the use of a security Alkaroid for this clock tower.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
041	A security Alkaroid...?! Are you talking about that Alkaroid that the Beckrams announced?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0013
042	Hahah. Look at that change in your eyes. You're pretty sharp-sighted when it comes to new products like that.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0011
043	Once the practical application of Alkaroids is implemented, you should have an increased role.
044	But why Alkaroids? This clock tower has been under the management of the Elesters since ancient times.
045	Also doesn't the Elesters have the Alkemono series?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0016
046	It seems like the Beckrams are desperate to sell their Alkaroids.
047	They even asked the Elesters to try them out.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
048	These are people who may very well be our rivals eventually. Honestly, the master is too kind-hearted sometimes.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0030
049	Ohhh!
050	It's the sound of celebration bells! Wow, wow!
051	Indeed. You can hear it louder than anywhere else here, can't you?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
052	Yes!
053	It's the...sound of happiness.
054	The sounds of happiness...?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
055	Ye-yes... What's the matter? Did I say something strange?
056	No. It's just that I knew someone who said something similar. It surprised me a little.
057	Hey...has time...still stopped for you?	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0029
058	...Sorry. I should be getting back to work.
059	Veloz...
060	See you, Veloz!
061	Yes...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
062	The sound of happiness, huh?
063	Lord Alvarez, preparation has been completed. All 30 deployed Alkaroids are under control.
064	All right. Begin immediately.
065	There should be some kind of clue in that clock tower. Don't miss even the smallest detail.
066	Yes, sir!
067	This towering clock tower from an ancient era...there must be some hint that leads to the Scared Stone Belphegor!
068	All right, repairs completed. I guess that does it.
069	Hey, what's that?
070	Whoa?! Hey, don't call out all of a sudden. It's dangerous.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0026
071	Wait, Fiona?! What are you doing here?
072	There are so many machines! Hey...do you work here, Veloz?
073	Y-yeah...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
074	Oh, I've seen this before! It's a machine that makes bread!
075	Very good. This is a bakery cauldron.
076	At first glance, it appears to be a normal cauldron, but it's different. A special material is used for the coating inside.
077	Special...?
078	It's created with a special cutting-edge material that has high heat conductive value. Put in numbers, when comparing it with current products...
079	Heat...conduc...tive?
080	Ah...sorry. Of course, you don't understand.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
081	Heheh. I guess you like machines. Jeez, Veloz. You remind me of Ethan.
082	Ah...I guess.
083	Oh! This photo...there's a woman in it!
084	That's...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
085	Hey, this person... Is she the one who told you about your favorite place?
086	Well, yes...
087	Is she your lover? She's so beautiful!
088	Yes, she was beautiful. And she was very kind-hearted...more so than I deserved.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
089	Did she go somewhere?
090	Yes. Somewhere very far.
091	You can't see her anymore?
092	Yes. Unfortunately.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
093	I see. It's sad, isn't it?
094	Anyway, did you come here for something specific?
095	Oh, that's right! My father sent me on an errand!
096	Your father...you mean the mayor?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0016
097	Yes! He told me to call you up to the clock tower!
098	But don't you think it's dangerous? Maybe it's best if we call someone from the Beckrams...
099	No. First, we must determine the cause on our own. It may be a risk to the entire city.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0039
100	Excuse me...?
101	Ah, I'm glad you came. Let me introduce you. This is Mayor Edward.
102	So you're Veloz. Thank you for always looking after Ethan.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0031
103	I've hardly looked after him. I'm just a mechanical engineer.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0007
104	Why did you call me here?
105	The thing is...last night, we had an incident where the security Alkaroid...the Guard Droid went rogue.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0031
106	Went rogue?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
107	That's not all.
108	Do you know the bell in the clock tower? Its power unit has been occupied by the rogue Guard Droid.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
109	Hey, hold on. You're not expecting me to go there and stop it, are you?
110	I heard that you are well-versed with mechanical technology. I want you to lend us your strength.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0004
111	He-hey, hold on! Why me?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0012
112	First of all...shouldn't you be dealing with someone associated with the Beckrams?
113	You should be calling the Beckrams not me!
114	No, well...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0029
115	To tell you the truth...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
116	Before we call the Beckrams, we want to be sure that there is no serious flaw with the Alkaroids.
117	Master...!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
118	It's okay, Ethan. What he says makes sense. But...I want you to consider this for the sake of the city.
119	What do you mean?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0017
120	Currently, the Beckrams are rushing to expand the uses of their Alkaroids.
121	That alone is not problematic.
122	However...if there is a serious flaw in this product that they're so proud of...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0031
123	You think they might try to hide it?
124	We can only make assumptions at this point.
125	But...if something like that were to happen, the victims would be the people of the city who use their products.
126	As mayor, I must prevent any danger from occurring in this city. 	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0016
127	... ...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0016
128	You're interested in Alkaroids, aren't you, Veloz?
129	Honestly. How can I resist when you put it that way? I may not be able to obtain the necessary results. Please don't rely on me too much.
130	I'm sorry for asking the impossible of you.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0035
131	Regarding the bell, I'll need to see it first before I can say anything.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0005
132	First of all, we need to decide what to do about the Guard Droid.
