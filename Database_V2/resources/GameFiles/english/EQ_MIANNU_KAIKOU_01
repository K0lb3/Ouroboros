001	Mm. I'm gonna do my best today!
002	Ouch... I fell.
003	Come on! I don't have time for this!
004	To become an Archmage, I need to practice magic as much as I can.
005	Here I go! Take that!
006	Oh... I messed up again.
007	Since my school years, I was always the best at magic theory. What am I doing wrong?
008	Oh! Perfect timing!
009	Um... Would you mind if I performed magic on you?
010	Ah! No, I'm not dangerous! Don't walk away! Pleeeease!!!
011	I've done research at the Magic Research Lab of Envylia for a long time.
012	I know my theory, but for some reason, I'm not very good at putting it into practice!
013	I remember once when I messed up and accidentally blew up the laboratory.
014	Old man Decel, the founder of the lab, used to get mad at me all the time.
015	There were times when I thought my heart would break.
016	That's when I'd look out of the laboratory window and watch Captain Chloe of the Crown's Guard, training.
017	Watching her gave me the strength to try harder!
018	From the moment I saw you, I felt that you could help me!
019	I want to be better than anyone at magic! Please!
