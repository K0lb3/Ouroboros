001	Huff...huff... This is tough. Hey, Seida, is it really a shortcut to go through this mountain path?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
002	I can sense the 4th Regiment spread out on the other side of this hill.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
003	It'll save us a lot of time to cut across the hill than to make our way around it.
004	Besides, there are much fewer monsters. Isn't that right, Almira?
005	Oh, right! It's true that there's a wide plain on the other side of this hill, but...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0004
006	But what?
007	No, I was just impressed that you knew about it! I guess I should expect that much from my teacher!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
008	Now that I think about it, it's true. You seem to know a lot about this area, Seida.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
009	Seriously? You trained together and you don't know? Seida is originally from Saga. This prairie is practically her backyard.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
010	What?! I had no idea!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
011	Neither did I! I wonder if we've met somewhere before.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0045
012	I doubt it. That was a long time ago.
013	Oh, but wait. Does that mean you're also from one of the equestrian tribes?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0044
014	Yes. I'm from one of the equestrian tribes. What about it?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
015	What about it? You're my friend. I want to know these things.
016	It's irrelevant. This is the past I've abandoned long ago.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
017	Huh...?
018	Deputy Captain, no more unnecessary comments, please.
019	I told you about it because I thought it would be necessary for this expedition, but it's the past that I wish to forget.
020	Shouldn't you value your homeland?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0014
021	I don't know what happened, but your homeland is where you began and...
022	If you don't know what happened, then it would be more efficient if you kept your mouth shut.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0013
023	Hmph...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
024	...What's that?
