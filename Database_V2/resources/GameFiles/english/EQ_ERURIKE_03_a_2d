001	I-I thought my heart was gonna stop!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0018
002	It's still too early to heave a sigh of relief. Before the other guards see us, let's do what we came here to do and then get out of here...huh?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
003	Is there a voice coming from this back room?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
004	Quiet... It looks like we can peek in from here.
005	Heheh. We earned well today.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
006	Yeah. My blood ran cold when the Sand Hawks showed up, but that sandstorm saved us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
007	That being said, we've got quite a lot of product now. If we don't get rid of some of it soon, some of it might go bad.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
008	Well, with the Guild Guard snooping around, we can't make a single false move.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
009	Tsk. It's a hassle to take care of them. Here's your food!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
010	...!
011	That's the kid from earlier!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
012	Calm down, Elrike.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
013	But...! I can't believe they'd lock children up in a cage like that!	VO_elrike.elrike_battle_0019
014	It seems like the rumors were true.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
015	The rumors.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
016	Yes. There has been talk that the bandits who have been rampant around these parts lately have been using humans as products.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
017	From what I can see there's a lot of children, but some young women as well. I guess this is where all the missing travelers ended up.
018	What are they going to use all of these people for?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
019	I'm sure some of them will be sold as slaves and workers, but I can think of another more sinister use.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
020	Philosopher's Stones.
021	They may be using the forbidden arts to directly remove the Alchemia Particles from their bodies.
022	Oh...! That's horrible...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0027
023	Yes. Truly.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
024	Both we and the Guild had begun secretly investigating this matter, but...
025	I never expected us to find direct evidence right here.
026	The Guild and the Sand Hawks, huh?
027	I had no idea it had gotten to the point that you needed to combine forces.
028	Well, it was purposely kept quiet. That being said, amongst the merchants with keen eyes, I'm sure there were those who noticed.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
029	... ...
030	Is there any way we can save that child?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
031	Not right now, at any rate. It'll be difficult for just the two of us to free all those people.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0039
032	If we cause ruckus now and they go deeper into hiding, we'd have to start our investigation all over again.
033	I can't believe we're just going to leave them like this.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0022
034	It's just a matter of time. Their reign of terror won't last much longer.
035	Huh? What do you mean by that?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
036	You brat! What are you doing?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0024
037	?!
038	...Agh!
039	Hey, don't hurt the merchandise!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
040	Shut up! How dare you spit in my face! I'll kill you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
041	No! As a merchant, I can't stand by and watch you trade humans as if they were goods!	VO_elrike.elrike_battle_0019
042	What...?
043	Huh? Um?
044	... ...
045	I-I...um...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0020
046	An intruder!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
047	Elrike, we're gonna open all these cages! Try to free as many as you can!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
048	I...couldn't stop myself...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0027
049	Never mind that! Come on!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
050	Ye-yes!
051	It was definitely a foolish move. We should've laid low.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
052	I-I'm sorry.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
053	That being said, you stayed faithful to your beliefs as a merchant. That's not something anyone can do.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
054	I wouldn't be able to call myself a Sand Hawk if I abandoned you over this. So...
055	From now on, I want you to follow your judgment as we advance forward!
056	Hey! What's the matter?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
057	It's Balt the Storm! He's infiltrated our hideout!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
058	Calm down. We outnumber him. If we corner him, he won't be able to escape–	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0029
059	Bo-boss! It's the Guild Guard! The Sand Hawks are with them too!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
060	They're infiltrating the hideout!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
061	What did you say!?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
062	Huh? Wh-what the...!?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0027
063	It seems like reinforcements have arrived.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0009
064	Huh?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
065	Agh. Die!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
066	Elrike! Are you okay?!	VO_elaine.elaine_battle_0023
067	Huh, Elaine?! Why...?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
068	I was hired by the Guild! Seriously. You're always putting yourself in harm's way.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0031
069	Deputy Commander Balt! We've finally caught up!
070	Yeah. I'll compliment you on your timing. How many of the men have you brought?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
071	Half! The rest are with the Commander. They've gone to protect the caravan.
072	Very well. That should be enough!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0032
073	That being said, the Guild must be desperate if they're now recruiting mercenaries.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
074	But how did they know we were here?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
075	I'll explain later. Right now we need to free all the children here. Come on, let's go!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0035
076	Ack!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
