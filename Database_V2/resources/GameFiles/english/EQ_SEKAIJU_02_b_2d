001	Thank you. Thanks to you, my senses have returned to me.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
002	Wow, I didn't expect you to have such a sweet smile.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0009
003	I may be able to fulfill my original mission now.
004	Your original mission?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
005	To correct the link to this other world. In other words, to resolve these events.
006	Resolving these events huh...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
007	Wouldn't that be the same than quelling the monsters who wandered into this world, and destroying the source of this phenomenon? 
008	Does that mean... that our objectives are the same?	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0004
009	It seems like that.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0004
010	Let us work together then! That would definitely be more efficient! 	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0045
011	That... I cannot do.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0035
012	Huh? Why not?!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0017
013	I lost my mind because of this abnormal transmutation, but still... I ended up hurting, even killing people.
014	This is my problem, and I'm the one who needs to fix it.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
015	That's why I will go and destroy the thing that brought forth these events.
016	The thing that brought forth these events... Now you mention that, Ouroboros said the same thing. How do you know this?
017	Well... this same thing also transmuted me.
018	...!
019	If I come near, I may lose my mind again, and I cannot tell how that would manifest itself.
020	I may blindly attack you three or the soldiers again.
021	That's why I suggest to act separately.
022	...
023	Why? I think it'll be fine.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
024	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
025	If something were to happen to you again, we'll just have to do something about it again, like we did earlier.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
026	R-right, we can do that.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0004
027	I can hear the shrieks of the Fierce Owlbear ahead. Since it's our mission to defeat it, we can't possibly stay out of this.
028	You guys...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
029	Alright then. But if I started acting strange, please don't hesitate to cut me down.
030	But you have such a sweet smile!<br>I could never do that.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
031	Hehe, weren't you the one who kept calling her scary until just a moment ago?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
032	D-don't say that!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0042
033	Come on, we'll be fine!<br>Alright, let's move on!	VO_fencer.fencer_battle_0015
