001	I got that you're related to the chief of the Alizehan tribe.
002	But what does that have to do with Gluttony's cavalry not wanting to lend us a hand?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
003	It's not very complicated.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
004	There is a deep feud that lies between the native Alizehan tribe and Gluttony.
005	A deep feud?
006	I've heard of that before.
007	The native Alizehan tribe, once known as the Wolves of the Plain, were once engaged in a long war with Gluttony.
008	You can't call that a war. It was a one-sided invasion.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
009	Those from Gluttony attempted to oppress, exploit, and turn those of the Alizehan tribe into slaves.
010	It's natural that such egregious actions would be met with resistance.
011	I agree.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
012	As a result of their defiance, Gluttony also suffered extensive damage.
013	The war raged on for a long time. Because of this, their hostile relationship continues on to this day.
014	So basically...there's no way they'd help the Holy Guard who employs knights belonging to the tribe they'll never conquer.
015	Exactly. Do you understand now?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
016	But...isn't there some way we can convince them?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
017	That would be completely inefficient. Let's hurry to the wind shrine.	VO_caida.caida_chara_0012
018	Wait! I told you that we should first head to Gluttony!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
019	There is a sinister presence at the wind shrine! I'm certain that the 4th Regiment has headed that way as well.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0016
020	Also...the lives of all from the Alizehan tribe are in danger!
021	I cannot accept that. The Alizehan tribe only accounts for a small portion of the native tribes here.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
022	Hey, Deputy Captain!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
023	What did you say?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
024	Of course, I'd like to help them if we could.	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
025	However, there is no way we can risk the lives of humanity in order to do so! Don't you agree?!
026	We are the Holy Guard. We exist to maintain peace within the continent. If the Sacred Stone in Gluttony were to be stolen...
027	If its powers were to be exploited, we're not just talking about a local native tribe...the lives of millions will be at risk.
028	Are you an idiot?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0015
029	It's not there! I am certain of it! The Sacred Stone is not in Gluttony!
030	What do you mean?
031	... ...
032	Answer me. How can you be so sure?
033	... ...
034	You're bluffing. In that case, I reject your proposal. We won't waste any more time here.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
035	We're going to head straight for to the center of Gluttony. I'm ordering you as your Deputy Captain.
036	Don't you understand what I'm saying?	VO_caida.caida_chara_0011
037	As a knight, you must follow through on the order given to you! There is no excuse for insubordination!
038	If you resist, then you are guilty of violating a direct order! If you still wish to act on your own accord...then you don't belong in the 2nd Regiment!
039	Fine! I'll give this thing back to you.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0045
040	Seida?! That's your coat of arms!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
041	I'm gonna do what I need to do. Feels refreshing, actually. Bye!
042	Ohh, teacher!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0019
