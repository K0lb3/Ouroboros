001	Bwahahah!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0011
002	What are you laughing about?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
003	Men and women live together? Those kinds of ideals don't work in this country. In fact, that ideal can sometimes end up stabbing you in the back!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
004	?!
005	I was actually going to use you as a trump card for taking down the queen, but...I'm sure you'll do a sparring partner...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0030
006	For this Ant King Kaiser!
007	Ant...King?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
008	The liquid that drips from ants as they make their way towards their goal has guided many a man who is turned into an insect.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0004
009	It has led them to the tree made from Philosopher's Stones–the Second Babel.
010	The sap from the Second Babel provided power to mere insects and caused them to evolve. It's what caused the outbreak of Vermin!
011	!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
012	When we found the Second Babel, there was already a Vermin society created there.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
013	This ant had become the center of its society. Do you under, Lisbeth?!
014	As a result of men and women trying to live together, men who were turned into insects struggled to live longer, causing them to evolve into Vermin.
015	Eventually, we've grown into a force this size!
016	Oh no...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
017	This is the ultimate Vermin that was created from your ideal of men and women living together.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0007
018	Kaiser, if we combine our anger, we can flip this country around.
019	Lisbeth, as a sacrifice towards this cause, I'll kill you here right now!	VO_salomo.salomo_battle_0010
020	Stop! Don't force the insect to fight!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
