001	Lady Chloe, about today's patrol...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
002	Pl-please. I still haven't fully earned the title of Captain.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0047
003	But it was thanks to you, Captain Chloe, that our squadron was awarded a medal of honor.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0027
004	Now that the whole country refers to you as Captain Chloe, we should call you the same.
005	But it's not through my strength, but all of yours that we received the medal.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
006	I'm honored to be in this squadron. I believe that you are the best commander in this country right now!
007	No, I still have a lot to learn. I'm doing my best to become a knight worthy of being a squadron commander, but...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
008	I still have a long way to go before being referred to as Captain.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0011
009	I see. Well then, shall I continue to call you Commander Chloe?	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0018
010	Yes. Please.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
011	Rookie! Have you finished your report?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0002
012	My apologies! Today's patrol will head south of the forest!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0036
013	Very well. Begin preparations.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
014	Understood! Excuse me.	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0002
015	Commander Chloe, are you still not used to being called Captain?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
016	No. After all, the title Captain should be reserved for such fine knights as Captain Vettel.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
017	I've still got a long way to go.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0011
018	I would disagree. You're fine knight and commander, Captain Chloe.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
019	I hope so, but...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
020	Your humility is part of your reputation. I won't say anything further.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
021	Thank you. Hearing that from a veteran knight like you makes me feel a little more confident.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0033
022	Well then, Commander, it seems preparation has been completed.
023	Yes. Let's go! Knights, advance!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0006
