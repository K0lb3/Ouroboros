001	Father!
002	Oh, Agatha.<br>What's the matter?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
003	Please just listen to me! Logi and Dias won't stop babbling about their battle! Even if it was their first battle, too much is too much!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
004	W-what's the big problem? We did such a good job that His Majesty even congratulated us.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
005	Don't you agree, Dias?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0002
006	Yes, with just the two of us, we defeated Vlad the Thunderer!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
007	Yeah, alright! You already told me that a thousand times! The stew is going to get cold, you know?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0030
008	Heh... Let me take the time to listen to your stories after we eat, so we can first enjoy a warm meal.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
009	Alright...
010	Enjoy the meal! 	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0007
011	Sure.
012	...
013	Father?<br>What's the matter?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0006
014	Well, it's just that...<br>You have all really grown up.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0005
015	Father! We've grown up so much that we managed to defeat Vlad the Thunderer! Isn't that right, Dias?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
016	Right!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
017	Oh, come on! Didn't you agree to keep that for after the meal?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
018	No second servings for you!
019	What?! Come on...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
020	And neither for you, Dias!
021	What? Why me as well?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
022	(It's all thanks to that day, that I earned such a lovely family around me, even after being called the Blood Wolf.)
023	(That innocent smile...)
024	(And these kids took a big step towards a world where Agatha can keep on smiling.)
025	(A world where these kids can live with a smile on their face. That is the peace I want to achieve.)
026	(And for that... I cannot allow myself to forget about my sins as the Blood Wolf.)
027	Father? Don't you like the stew?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0002
028	Oh, sorry, sorry! How could I ever dislike your stew, Agatha?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
029	Don't you agree, guys?
030	I agree!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
031	Right, Agatha's stew is really the best!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0045
032	Praising me like that isn't going to get you a second serving!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0029
033	This one man who sealed the flame of envy in his heart to bring about a peaceful world.
034	Though continuing to bear his past sins, this man's unwavering will was inherited by his family.
035	The gears of destiny which this man had set in motion, continued shaping people's lives until this day.
036	What may the future hold? A peaceful world filled with laughter, or one filled with sorrow?
037	The answer to that question lays dormant in the unknown future.
038	Huh?! Where am I? What on earth...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
039	Heh... I see. Who would have thought that I'd ever be transmuted, after all my efforts of sealing Alchemy away.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
040	Well, I suppose I can't help it.<br>This is part of destiny as well.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
041	If for a strong spirit who aims for peace, who doesn't get swayed by power, I could lend my strength.
