001	Ah...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0024
002	Your power far suppresses my expectations. Wonderful.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
003	This will end it all. Rest in peace!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
004	That's a request I cannot satisfy.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
005	Oh no! He's gonna try to run away!
006	Now, now. Don't make me sound like a coward. There's such a thing as timing, and I have now outstayed my welcome.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0016
007	You know where the Sacred Stone is located. I have gained more than enough from that information alone.
008	Enjoy your fleeting peace while you can. Next time, things will not go as well for you.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
009	Ack. No!
010	I won't let you escape!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
011	It's too late. He's already disappeared. More importantly, we should get to Kudan.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
012	You're right. Let's rendezvous with him.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
013	Captain Kudan!
014	Oh, it's you...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
015	You're safe! Seriously! Don't go off on your own like that! You scared me.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
016	I'm sorry, Kagura.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
017	Where the enemy? Where is the major enemy that you were chasing? Did they escape?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
018	He's not here. I eradicate him.
019	Did you eradicate him? In other words, you defeated him?
020	What else could I mean?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
021	Yeah! I wouldn't expect any less from you, Kudan! I guess that means we've completed our mission.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0024
022	Yes... Let's go home, everyone.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
023	...?
024	Kudan...there's something I want to ask you.
025	... ...
026	You said that you defeated a major enemy who was moving about suspiciously. Is that true?
027	Why would I lie?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
028	There are no traces of this opponent.
029	... ...
030	Knowing your strength, I have little doubt that you could completely eradicate someone.
031	However, there should be some trace left behind. I can't see anything here.
032	There aren't even traces of a battle. What happened here?
033	Who knows? Unfortunately, I don't have the answers.
034	... ...
035	You did it, Captain Kudan! Deputy Captain Monzein! Let's celebrate once we get back!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
036	Yes...let's do that.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
037	Stop getting carried away, Kanon! We don't know when the monsters might attack again!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
038	Yeah, Yeah. I'm well aware of that, Kagura!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
039	Was it not Orion who was after the Sacred Stone?
040	... ...
041	I received information that he is looking for the Sacred Stone. What did you talk with him about?
042	...Who knows?
043	Why are you feigning ignorance? This situation could very well turn into a war. We need to share information.
044	Monzein...don't you feel it?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
045	Feel what?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
046	This emptiness. No matter how much we fight for justice, evil does not disappear from this world.
047	All of this is due to our lack of power. Have you not felt the same? If...
048	If I could obtain absolute power...then I could protect everyone.
049	!!!
050	Kudan, Deputy Captain?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
051	What's got into the two of them?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
052	Nothing. They're always like that.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
053	They'll settle it eventually, so go on ahead.
054	But...
055	Please. Arguing here will be inefficient.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
056	Fine. Kanon! Come on, let's go.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0030
057	Huh?! Hold on!
058	Seida, were you listening?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
059	Yes. Reluctantly.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
060	Forget it all. This is my order to you as Deputy Captain. I also forbid you from telling the others. Do you understand?
061	Yes...
062	Kudan...I will pretend like I didn't hear what you just said.
063	Open your eyes. There are those who rely on you.
064	Yes...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
065	I'm sorry. Something was wrong with me.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
066	As you long as you understand now. Let's go.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
067	... ...
068	But...
069	I must determine the true nature of the Holy Guard.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
070	Heheh. According to how I use him, he could be an interesting tool to work with.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
071	Heheheh.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
