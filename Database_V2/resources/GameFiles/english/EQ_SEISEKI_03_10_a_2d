001	Deputy Captain Monzein!
002	Ah, you caught up! Is Kagura already able to move?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0024
003	Yes. Thanks to a talented doctor. More importantly, where's Kudan?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
004	I'm certain he's here, but there are so many rooms. I'm checking each one carefully.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
005	There will be no need for that.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
006	Waginau!
007	What are you doing coming out of the wood work? Have you got tired of the chase?	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
008	Indeed. I'm ready now.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
009	...?!
010	I'll ask you one more time. Seida, where is the Sacred Stone?
011	I already told you I didn't know.
012	...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
013	Heheh. Lying isn't good–especially for one who is part of the Holy Guard.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
014	What do you mean?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
015	This spell...let's just say that it may respond when the person under it lies.
016	Huh?! Then he knows about you and the Sacred Stone, Seida!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
017	Heheh. Thank you, young ladies.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
018	Actually, all this spell does is light up red when pointed at a target.
019	Whaaat...?!
020	So you tricked us?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
021	Indeed. Thanks to that I now know exactly where the Sacred Stone is located.
022	I'm sorry, Seida. I guess I can't make fun of Kanon anymore.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0035
023	Don't worry about it.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
024	Either way, it doesn't change the fact that we're going to defeat him.
025	Fine. Give it your best shot.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
026	Heheh. After I defeat you lot, I will pry out the location of the Sacred Stone from you while extinguishing your lives one at a time.
027	We won't let you! We will use the light of us four Holy Guard's to shatter your darkness!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
028	Don't forget about me too!
029	Of course! Everyone, let's go!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0015
