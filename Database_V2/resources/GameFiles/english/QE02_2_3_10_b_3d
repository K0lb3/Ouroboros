001	Tsk! He's fast!
002	No matter how many times you challenge me, you still stand no chance. I can see the trajectory of every shot you fire.
003	You sure about that? Tell that to me after you've shot me down!
004	Huh?! It's vanished!
005	Aye, it's behind you!
006	You fought well, Edgar L. Leonhart. I will carve you into my memory.	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0005
007	No...!
008	Goodbye!
009	Ah...ugh....aghh...!!!
010	Edgar!!!
011	Aye!!!
012	Ru...run...! Al...kemono...save...the little lady!
013	Edgar!!! Edgar!!!
014	The was a sure shot. Your cries are useless; he won't answer.
015	Come on, let's go. Lord Alvarez is waiting.
016	N-noo...!
017	Aye!
018	Don't get in my way. Your resistance will have no stop me.
019	I won't let you take Fiona! Aye, I'm gonna protect her!
020	What a strange Alkemono. Have you inherited feelings?	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0007
021	Fiona, jump out of the window! Aye, that's what Edgar told me!
022	You still won't stand down? Very well...I must take care of you too then.
023	Al!
024	When faced against a highly skilled gunslinger...there are two ways of defeating them.
025	Either show greater skill or...lure them into lowering their guard.
026	You...?!
027	Honestly, you've got incredible skill, but you lack experience!
028	Agh...!!! How...how is this...possible?	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0008
029	Edgar! Are you okay?!
030	Heh. Looks like it. Seems it missed my vitals. I've managed to survive again.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
031	Edgar! I'm so relieved!
032	Honestly, you got me involved in a lot of trouble. Are you listening, clock protector?
033	Ethan...?
034	Oww... Honestly...where is the Sacred Stone?
035	It's the root of all of this. You have an idea about where it is, right?
036	So...you don't know where the Sacred Stone is...after all...	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0009
037	You're still alive?!
038	Ohh?! N-no! Let me go!
039	I'll deliver you to Lord Alvarez. Get into the compartment.
040	Eeek!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
041	Fiona!
042	You...!
043	Someone from the Beckrams should come to retrieve you. Please stay put for a while.
044	Are you gonna disconnect the compartment?!
045	Edgar!!!
046	Little lady!!! Tsk... Get out of the way!
047	Gunslinger... You will die along with me.
048	Are you gonna try to self-destruct?! Ack! We're getting out of here, Ethan!
049	Ethan...? Are you referring to this?
050	What the...?! A human-shaped bomb!
051	Ack... My functions will soon be terminated. I'm glad...to have met you!	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0010
052	Is this a four-sided version of that impenetrable wall...?! You...! Let me out of here!
053	Agh! It doesn't budge! That idiot!!!
054	Huff...huff... Oh well...I guess this is how it ends for me.
055	Your appearance completely messed up my calculations. Don't get in the way.
056	Who's that?!
057	The wall! Ack! There's no time!!! Aghhhh!!!
058	...!
059	There's no role for you in this. Got it? Don't get involved any further.
060	What?!
061	No! No! Noooo!!!
