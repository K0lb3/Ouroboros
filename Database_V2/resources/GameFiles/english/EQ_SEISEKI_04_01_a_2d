001	Day of Strategy Implementation<br><br>Midnight<br><br>Off the Coast of Wadatsumi<br><br>Aboard a Vessel
002	It's coming into view. That's the port of Wadatsumi.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
003	Yes. There's no doubt about it.
004	Your voice is quivering, Kagura. Are you nervous?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
005	No. It's just that...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
006	Are you feeling nostalgic?
007	Home is home, even if it's transformed into something as desolate as this.
008	Kagura...we must complete this mission.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
009	After all, the only thing that can destroy that thing is my sword and your skillset.
010	I'm aware of that. The power of Mikaboshi must not be unleashed into the world.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
011	Now that it has been uncovered, as a Paladin of the Holy Guard, we cannot do anything.
012	Besides, it is also the destiny of my family, so it is worth risking my life for.
013	At the moment, it is still unclear regarding the number of conflicting forces who will be after the Mikoboshi.
014	However, in order to avoid a single casualty, we must thoroughly prepare before implementing our strategy.
015	Just as expected, Yauras should be now leading the knights of each regiment in pursuit of us.
016	What about the 4th Regiment?
017	They haven't been notified. I'm keeping it a secret from them. If Kudan were to come, it may become problematic.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
018	... ...
019	For him, Wadatsumi is a place that changed who he was.
020	Having experienced his own weakness there, it changed his core ambition to passionately seeking power.
021	If Kudan were to learn about the dormant Mikaboshi, one can only imagine what this will lead to.
022	If he were to forget his own morals in his pursuit of power...
023	In order to avoid the worst case scenario, we must keep him out of this.
024	I don't want to think of that.
025	Yes. But...I understand. We cannot allow Kudan to get any closer to the darkness.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
026	After everything is over, we can explain to him what had happened. The best we can wish for is that he will understand if not agree with this decision.
027	In order to make this work, we must complete this mission swiftly.
028	You've grown, Kagura. As Lord Commander, I am proud of you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0024
029	Thank you!
030	It appears that our welcoming party has come.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
031	Huh...?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
032	!!!
033	Let's go, Kagura! Let's go save this world! ...Rising Sun!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0001
034	Kanon and the other have managed to protect the Sacred Stone that has long belonged to Saga.
035	However, the clothes of those seeking power have begun to tighten.
036	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
037	Sacred Stone Memories - Inherited Cause
038	A Few Days Earlier...<br>Holy Guard - Council Room
039	There have been reports of skirmishes between a few tribes in rural areas of Saga. However, they appear unlikely to develop into bigger problems.
040	In Gluttony's desert lands, there has recently been a pattern of large-scale bandit groups showing up and going on a rampage.
041	The Guild led by Ryle and the Sand Hawks led by an individual called Balt have been working together to stop the bandits, but...
042	Whether or not they have been cooperating with each other is under suspicion.
043	Around Wratharis, there is increasing discontent of farmers against the large landowners. It appears they are considering an uprising.
044	Hmm... Well then, of the Paladins we've dispatched to the Saga region, send two battalions toward Gluttony.
045	Yes, Sir!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
046	Use the Paladins currently stationed in Gluttony to act as a cushion between the Guild and the vigilantes, so that everyone can focus on the bandits.
047	Understood.
048	The situation around Wratharis is a little complicated. If we dispatch Paladins without fully explaining the situation, the citizens could rise up in revolt.
049	We'll dispatch several Paladins. They will work with the land owners and the farmers to reach a middle ground.
050	If we can solve problems through communication, then that's always the best.
051	I agree.
052	Excuse me.
053	Kudan...you're back. I thought I tasked you with dealing with the extreme rebels that have appeared in Slothstein.
054	Yes. I've dealt with them just as you ordered. I've come here to report on it.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
055	Hmm. So you managed to quell a rebellion like that within a few days, huh?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
056	Never mind that. Give me my next assignment.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
057	Wielding my spear against amateurs who are extremists only in name leaves me wanting.
058	Please give me a more solid mission–one that I can bite into.
059	Heheh. Always the same, aren't you?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
060	Unfortunately, there are no missions that I can currently send you on. Take this opportunity, to rest your body.
061	Tsk...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
062	Huff...huff... Sir, I have a minor report to make. Please lend me your ear.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0024
063	... ...
064	...Hmph.
065	Is that really the truth?
066	There are many prying ears around here. Tell me the details later...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
067	Understood.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0037
068	Everyone! My apologies, but we need to suspend this council temporarily. Please take the time to rest.
069	...?
070	Our conversation should be safe here. Now tell me in more de...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
071	Hey, who are you people?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
