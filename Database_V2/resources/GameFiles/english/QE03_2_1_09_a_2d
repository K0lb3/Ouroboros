001	Huff... huff... This is getting...tough.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	Liz...what did you mean when you said, ‘we won't be able to regain trust'?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
003	Well...the other students were glaring at Rebecca because she came to my defense...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
004	And when I think how school will become a hostile environment for you as well, Alma...
005	I couldn't care less about that actually.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
006	Me neither!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
007	Still, I want to do something about it! To do so, I need to prove to the people of this country that my power is not evil!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
008	I'm gonna fix what's wrong with this country and make it so that you, Alma, and Rebecca don't get glared at!
009	Hold on. So you don't just want to prove it to those in school...but to the entire country?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
010	Seriously, you're always thinking on a overly grand scale.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0023
011	Well, thanks to that, I can follow you without getting bored.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
012	Alma...thanks!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0033
013	Far from running away...they've heading deeper into the school. What is their goal?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0020
014	Please let us meet the headmistress! We need to talk with her!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
015	What nonsense!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
