001	Wh-what...?! Setsuna!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
002	All right. Let's finish for now. I just received some food, so eat.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0037
003	Huh? N-no...more importantly, about our conversation just now...about Envylia...!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0019
004	Right now, Logi, your brain lacks nutrition. Even if we continued to talk now, you will just remain pessimistic. A fatigued mind and empty stomach weakens the heart.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0040
005	Ack... Un-understood.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
006	This brings back memories. We used to eat like this together, didn't we? We decided that we would always eat after training.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0008
007	Yes.
008	It was hard training under you, but...back then, things were a lot of fun.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
009	...They were for me too.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0007
010	The truth is, I was never very good at teaching people...but I did enjoy our time together.
011	I was wandering aimlessly, having lost everything. I am truly grateful to Zeke for providing me with another chance to experience warmth again.
012	I was really surprised when Zeke told me that he wanted me to train the two of you.
013	He could've trained you himself, but he went out of his way to ask me. Do you know why that is?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
014	Huh...? N-no...
015	There was a darkness to that blade of his. When one wields a blade against another human, this will inevitably happen. But, if you're not careful, eventually that darkness will turn against you.
016	He didn't want to teach the two of you to fight that way. That's why Zeke asked me. There was no darkness to my blade–it was a pure power.
017	You and Dias were Zeke's hope. He wanted to raise you to wield your blade without a shred of darkness. The two of you had that potential.
018	For that reason especially, I taught only the two of you how to wield your blades.
019	And yet...Dias is now gone and find you lying on the ground here.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0030
020	Seeing the destruction of Envylia, I could hardly believe what had happened. Yet, seeing you now, I fully grasp that the country has fallen.
021	The destruction...?! Envylia...fallen?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
022	So you really didn't know. Right now, it's under the jurisdiction of the Holy Guard, but it's not a very safe place to be.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0031
023	How is this possible? We fought so hard...for peace...for peace between Envylia and Wratharis!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
024	I see. So you still believe that nonsense, do you?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0045
025	Huh...?
026	I seem to have failed to teach you properly. Logi, Let's go another round after eating. There should be something more you have to say with that blade of yours.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0017
027	Wh-why...?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0021
028	That way you can protect what is important to you next time.
029	!!!
