001	That's the answer!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
002	I'll fight in a way to that will allow me to protect everyone and unleash my strength!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0017
003	I need to remember all that's happened today.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
004	Yes. Let me use this crystal shard to make something. Every time I see this glimmer it will be a reminder.
005	I'll remember today and what I need to do as commander.
006	Besides, the glow has a similar quality to glass.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
007	I imagine Captain Vettel's face and...heh...I feel calmer!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0008
008	...Excuse me!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
009	Eeek?! Oh, um...! Ehem... Wh-what's the matter?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0028
010	Commander Chloe...no, Captain Chloe, you seemed to be worrying over something, so I thought I could be of an assistance.
011	However, it seems like that's no longer necessary.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
012	I-I'm sorry for embarrassing myself in front of you.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0049
013	No, Captain Chloe.
014	I've respected and trusted you ever since you became our commander, Captain Chloe.
015	You are trying to become stronger to protect us.
016	So please also believe in us as well, Captain Chloe. The Crown's Guard needs you as our commander.
017	...Thank you.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0033
018	Captain, huh? I need to train myself to protect all of you and become worthy of that title.
019	Hah. If you'd like to train, I'd gladly assist you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
020	Heheh. I'll be training while collecting crystals. It'll take time.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
021	You shouldn't underestimate your veteran knights, Captain.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0008
022	My apologies! Well then, let's go!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0008
023	Understood!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
024	Through having gained confidence, pride, and a goal, Chloe has now gained a new weapon and the power to match it.
