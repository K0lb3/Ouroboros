001	Phew... We managed to defeat them, but all this fighting is starting to take its toll.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
002	You're right. Depleting all our energy will be foolish. Let's rest here.
003	I hope there's water around somewhere. I'll look for a spring. Hold on!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
004	... ...
005	... ...
006	Um, Captain?
007	I'm sorry about just now. I should never have lost my cool like that during a mission.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
008	Don't worry about it! More importantly, about that earlier question...
009	I do believe what Captain Cadanova said was true!
010	Power won't solve anything. Only the heart of justice will overcome—
011	I told you; those are ideals!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
012	...?!
013	Something as uncertain as justice cannot suppress the darkness of the heart!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
014	The darkness of the heart...?
015	During the destruction of Wadatsumi, I witnessed the same hell that Kagura did.
016	Having been there at the time for my studies, I fought as hard as I could with my few comrades, to protect the royal family.
017	Ultimately, only Kagura and I survived.
018	What...?
019	I boasted more strength than any of the other knights present at the time. I was also confident that I could beat anyone.
020	However, I was completely powerless.
021	No matter how much I wielded my sword or I took down the enemy, I couldn't stop the burning of the town nor the ruthless slaughter.
022	In the end, my power wasn't able to change anything.
023	It could neither protect Captain Cadanova nor Wadatsumi!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
024	Captain Kudan...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
025	That's not true! You did do something. You saved Kagura's life.
026	Yeah, that's true.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
027	However, she remains one life in contrast to the countless people who were slain!
028	... ...
029	I was unable to stop the destruction of Wadatsumi. As I tasted my powerlessness, I could feel the darkness swelling in my heart.
030	I wanted to massacre all those devils who burned that beautiful forest and slaughtered those innocent lives.
031	That was the justice I desired to enforce.
032	...?!
033	I felt the same when the invasion ended, and no punishment was given to Greed Dike who had destroyed Wadatsumi.
034	If something so outrageous were to be forgiven, then I, too, should be allowed to destroy Greed Dike with my own hands. 
035	... ...
036	I wanted to obtain enough power to punish Greed Dike and enforce my justice.
037	However, I quickly regained my sanity. I realized that if I let this darkness engulf my heart, I too would be consumed.
038	Thus, I forced myself to bury it deep within me.
039	To this day, I use my willpower to discard myself of all emotions. 
040	... ...
041	You understand now, don't you? Justice can't suppress the darkness.
042	Justice is malleable and can itself be tainted with darkness, as mine was then.
043	Only power can counteract the darkness—overwhelming, pure, and all-transcending power.
044	I...
045	I don't believe that!
046	...?!
047	In fact, I'll shine the light of justice on you!
