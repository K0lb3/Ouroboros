001	It is done. Everyone good?
002	Aye. Thanks to you we made short work of them.
003	The name's Amos. Come, I'll take you to the village. We can talk along the way.
004	You've never had any trouble with raiders trying to pillage your settlement?
005	Nah. Most we get are lizardmen or wolves who get too curious for their own good. And the occasional drunk caravan guard.
006	That's interesting. After the upheaval from the warring era, raider bands frequently combed through this area and pillage isolated villages.
007	But that was at least a decade ago. Peace is returning to the land.
008	That it is. We owe our peace to our Divine Protector.
009	Divine protector?
010	Our village was founded with the protection of the Divine and we've never faced any major trouble since then.
011	We have arrived. Welcome to Sacris Village.
