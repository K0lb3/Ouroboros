001	Young lady, I'm glad you're safe. Are you hurt?	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0004
002	No. Edgar and Ronnie risked their lives to save me.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
003	Risked their lives, huh? That's some resolve you got there. Well done, Ronnie.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0024
004	He-heheh. Nah, it was nothing!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0049
005	Well, what's he up to then?
006	Oh! Let him be for now. He's depressed that the redhead beat him.
007	Depressed, huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
008	Gwahahahah!!! Well, that's hilarious!!! So you finally got thrown off your high horse!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0008
009	Shut up, loser.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
010	What's that?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
011	You disappeared at the most crucial moment. Did you go running back to your momma?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
012	I'm gonna kill you!!!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0026
013	I'd love to see you try! I just happened to be boiling over with anger right now, you massive-armed idiot!!!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0032
014	Stop, please! We were finally able to come together. Why do you have to fight?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
015	Ack... Sorry. Just call it reflective instincts.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
016	Heh. You're a real wuss when it comes to women, aren't you?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
017	Edgar!!!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
018	Tsk. Fine. Well, we managed to gain an advantage over that redhead...so I guess I can live with that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
019	An advantage? What do you mean?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
020	I've finally had an idea about where the Sacred Stone might be.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
021	What?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
022	While we were fighting inside the train compartment... 
023	This little guy asked me why I didn't accept the power at the Door of Truth. That's when I realized... 
024	Which little guy?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
025	It was right in front of our noses the whole time!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
026	Alkemono, you're the one who has the Sacred Stone Belphegor!!!
027	Squeak...?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
028	Al has it?! What do you mean?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
029	Think back. Ethan told you that this little guy would lead you to the Sacred Stone.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
030	When we asked where the Sacred Stone was located, he showed us a map with our current location marked on it.
031	More importantly...he has emotions and the ability to speak.
032	It's true that Al started speaking after Ethan entrusted me with this!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0045
033	Alkemono, you have the Sacred Stone Belphegor inside you! Right?!
034	Squeak...?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
035	Don't squeak at me. Stop feigning ignorance with your squeaks!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
036	Squeak! Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
037	Something's wrong with it. Alkemono?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0001
038	I remember Logi was tampering with Al before you and the others arrived, Edgar!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
039	That scum!!!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0007
040	Squeak...!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
041	It's no good. The Sacred Stone doesn't seem to be responding. Hey, what are we supposed to do?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0030
042	If we can't find him using the map, we've no choice but to search for him on foot.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
043	How are we supposed to find him? He's disappeared without a trace. Right, Tango?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
044	We've searched the surroundings, but there's no sign of him. It seems like he intended to disappear all along.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
045	Hmph. Maybe you guys just aren't very good at looking.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
046	What did you say...?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0026
047	Stop lashing out.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
048	It's important to be calm when you hit a roadblock. Wasn't that what you were always telling me, idiot?
049	Tsk. Shut up. Ultimately, it looks like we have to start at the beginning.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
050	The beginning?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
051	Ethan is the only remaining clue to the Sacred Stone's location. I'm going to save him.
052	Now that we know he wasn't on the train, the logical conclusion is that he's still captured.
053	You're heading to the Beckrams' mansion?!
054	Yep. The chances are slim, but we might obtain a clue to finding that redhead.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
055	So we're finally gonna infiltrate their home base!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0010
056	Jeez. Hey, Tango, prepare for battle.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
057	Yes, Don!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
058	Are you sure? I thought you had no intention of getting involved.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
059	I wanted to be sure of what he was made out of first. I know enough now. He doesn't have what it takes to lead this country.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
060	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
061	Come on. Enough chatter. It's been a long time coming, but we're off to battle now!
