001	You're amazing, teacher! I'm confident with the bow, but there's no way I could do what you just did!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0044
002	You come from a Saga hunting tribe. You'll learn to do it in no time at all.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
003	Hey, come on! Let's really go hunting together some day! We can compete who can catch more prey!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
004	No. I'd rather buy my food at a normal shop than doing something so inefficient.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
005	Awww...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0039
006	More importantly, Deputy Captain...
007	What is it?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
008	You saved me just now. If had tried to pull the bridge up on my own, I'm sure it would've pulled me down with it.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
009	I told you just now, didn't I? It's a knight's basic duty to protect his comrades.	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0004
010	Besides...thanks to that, we've been able to exponentially close the distance between us and the 4th Regiment. So, um...well done.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
011	...!
012	That's rare of you to compliment me so honestly.	VO_caida.caida_chara_0010
013	D-don't misunderstand me. It's not that I've accepted your way of thinking, but courtesy should be repaid with courtesy. That's my personal Code of Chivalry.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0047
014	Seriously. You're so stubborn.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
015	What did you say?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
016	B-but...I'm relieved! We managed to save time...and I think we've strengthened our bond!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0011
017	...True.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
018	Hey, look!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
019	What is it this time? Another bridge?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
020	No, it's not! The path...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
021	It divides into two.
022	Not only that; look over there.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
023	Is that...a blood trail?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
024	It seems like a battle took place here. The bushes also seem to be extremely ruffled. Most likely, it was fought against monsters.
025	Wait...there's something on the ground over there.
026	It's the coat of arms of the 4th Regiment!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
027	It appears that after Kudanstein and the others fought the monsters, they headed down this right path.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0045
028	Where does this road lead to?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
029	To the country of Gluttony Foss!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
030	What? That means...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
031	Wait.
032	Huh? Did you read the wind again?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
033	Yes. I can sense the sinister presence coming from down the left path.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
034	What does that mean?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
035	It means that the source behind this sinister presence is at the wind shrine up ahead.
036	The wind shrine?
037	It's a place that is said to collect the wind from all across the world. Sort of a spiritual symbol for the gods of the native equestrian tribe Alizehan.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
038	... ...
039	There's no doubt about it. I can still sense the sinister presence from up this left path.
040	Also...I can sense the presence of a lot of people.	VO_caida.caida_sys_18
041	Most likely, there's a settlement of the Alizehan tribe up ahead. They're in danger. We need to tell them to run.
042	Ohh, which way should we go?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
043	The right path, of course. It leads towards Gluttony. That country has the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
044	If those who are chasing Kudan and the others are after the Sacred Stone...
045	This could potentially lead to something that will shake the entire world.
046	What...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
