001	Are you safe, Agatha?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
002	Argh! This is all my fault!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
003	Now is the time for me to step up my game. Why can't I use Alchemy properly?
004	...When you're unsure of yourself, it only weakens the art.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
005	Dias! What're you doing here?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
006	I was passing nearby, so I came to see how you were doing.
007	I see.
008	A Paladin told me that an Alchemist's power sways according to their mental state.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
009	Don't be distracted by things that have already happened. Instead of focusing on the past, look ahead to the future.
010	Don't focus on the past, but look ahead?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0044
011	Yeah, I see what you mean. No matter how much you overthink something, you can't turn back time.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0004
012	You have to focus on what you're gonna do in the future!
013	Wow, that didn't take much to convince you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
014	Dias, I was convinced by watching the way you handle yourself.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
015	The way I handle myself?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	Yes. Are you doing well in the Holy Guards?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0045
017	Huh? Mm, well, I guess so.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0006
018	After I joined, I realized it's a lot different than I had imagined it.
019	I thought it was filled with people who abused their power, but they are surprisingly resolute and strong-willed.
020	I see. Then it must suit you well.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0044
021	What...?
022	You have an almost over-zealous drive and determination to change the world.
023	Especially when it involves Agatha, you can be even too stubborn for me to handle.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
024	It might be your feelings for the real sister you lost that are making you feel that way.
025	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
026	See what I mean? Look at you, Dias.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0004
027	You disliked the Holy Guard because they couldn't save your real sister Yuffy, right?
028	But now you've discarded those emotions in order to save Agatha.
029	You're a walking example to me of someone who doesn't focus on the past but looks ahead to the future.
030	...!!!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
031	Ah! I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bring up your painful past!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0035
032	No, it's all right. Yes...that's it!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0008
033	This, right here, is the cornerstone of my mental strength!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0009
034	Huh?
035	Thank you, Logi. Don't worry. I'm going to protect both you and Agatha.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0033
036	H-hey! Dias!
