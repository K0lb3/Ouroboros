001	Huh? The professors aren't chasing after us.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
002	Maybe they don't actually expect us to be heading to the headmistresses office.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
003	I think they're waiting for us outside the school.
004	If that's the case, it might be wise to try and convince the headmistress.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
005	If they surround us outside the school, we've no way of escape.
006	Don't worry. I'm sure the headmistress will understand!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
007	No way! What are you doing here?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
008	Lisbeth, I anticipated you would come here.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0030
009	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
010	One who has the power of Alchemy will eventually seek the Sacred Stone.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0010
011	When that happens, it is natural to visit an ancient witch who knows the history of this country–in this case, myself.
012	Then tell me, please! What can I do to remove the curse of Asmodeus?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
013	I will not be fooled!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_battle_0019
014	?!
015	You want to remove the curse? No one would seek the Sacred Stone for such superficially noble reasons!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0010
016	What you really want is the Sacred Stone's immense power for your own selfish reasons, correct?!
017	Like Mother who brought about disaster!
018	N-no, that's not true!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
019	Enough! All of you, restrain Lisbeth! Show no mercy, if they put up any resistance!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0013
020	Please...Headmistress!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
021	To put it bluntly, we're out of options! Looks like we have no choice but to fight!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
022	Here they come! Get ready!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
