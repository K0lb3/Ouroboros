001	Huh?!<br>What's wrong with this woman?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0026
002	No, Chloe!<br>Don't attack her!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
003	I know!<br>I know, but if this goes on...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
004	Ugh! Please wait!<br>Please just listen to...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
005	Be quiet!!! I'll have you realize Zain's regrets like this!<br>Supernova!!!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0012
006	!!!<br>Chloe!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
007	Ugh!!!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
008	Tsk! Quick on our feet, aren't we!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0043
009	I-I'm sure of it! It's not my imagination! Those are definitely Lord Zain's abilities!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
010	...?!<br>Hold on!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
011	Huh?
012	That sword!<br>Could that possibly be Guren Blade?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0021
013	Oh... t-this sword?<br>I received it from Captain Cadanova...
014	!!!
015	How could a little girl like you have murdered not alone Zain, but Cadanova as well?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
016	Huh?! You got the wrong idea! Captain Cadanova entrusted me with this sword!
017	Don't lie to me! There's no way Cadanova would have entrusted his sword to a little kid like you!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
018	Try to deceive me as much as you like! It's all meaningless in the face of Cadanova's true abilities!
019	Let me unmask you with this one attack!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0007
020	Captain Cadanova's abilities?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
021	Repent in the scorching flames!!!<br>Flaming Crimson Blade!!! 	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0014
022	What?! This is bad!<br>Chloe, get behind me!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
023	Ugh!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
024	Captain Cadanova, please lend me your strength!<br>Whhoaaaa!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
025	Whah!<br>This is bad! What an incredible destructive force!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0028
026	H-how is that possible?!<br>How did you...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0021
027	Like I told you earlier, Captain Cadanova entrusted this sword to me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
028	I really can't afford to be standing around here!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0017
029	I cannot have Captain's Cadanova's trust in me go to waste!
030	S-stop lying to me!!!<br>How could I ever believe that?!
031	How could Cadanova possibly entrust his sword to a little kid like you?!
032	You may understand if you'd just stop and listen! Calling me little girl, or little kid like that... Who on earth are you, rather?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0013
033	I really don't enjoy being called all of those things by a completely random person like you!
034	Now I'm pissed!<br>You'll definitely pay for this!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0016
035	My name is Miuna Ku! In the name of my great father Yogi Ku, I will knock you down!!!
036	Huh?!
037	You're the daughter of Yogi Ku?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
038	Zain and Cadanova were the glimmers of hope that would lead the world towards the future!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
039	I will make you people pay for killing them!
040	This is bad!<br>She's going to attack, Kanon!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
041	No, don't get hostile with her! She's just making a misunderstanding! It's okay, I will definitely get our feeling across!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
042	H-hey!<br>Why are you sheathing your sword?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
043	Miuna! This is all a misunderstanding! I don't bear any hostility towards you! Please believe me!
044	What sort of trick is this? Do you think you can calm my rage with a petty line like that?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
045	It's not a trick!<br>I'm showing you my true weapon!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
046	Weapon? What do you mean, Kanon?
047	My trust in justice inside my strong heart, that's my most powerful weapon! That's what Captain Cadanova taught me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0022
048	I can see that Miuna also has this justice in her heart... My message will definitely get across!
049	Why don't you give it a try! You can try whether such a naive way of thinking has any effect on me!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
050	K-Kanon!!!<br>Get away!!!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
051	No, I definitely won't!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
052	Do you really think I'll fall for your sweet words? Why don't you spend your time regretting in the afterlife!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0013
053	Succumb to the hell fire!<br>Scarlet's Hidden Flame!!!
054	...!
055	...
056	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
057	...You're quite a fool, aren't you?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0017
058	...I get that a lot.
059	Are you seriously telling me that you're the next Lord Commander, whom Zain and Cadanova entrusted the future to?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0022
060	I know it's a big title... but I suppose I'm the 11th Lord Commander.
061	...
062	You look really different from the stories I heard. But I'll listen to what you have to say.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
063	...O-okay!
064	I didn't expect to run into a follower of Zahar. It's pretty troublesome.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
065	Have you ever stood against Zahar yourself, Captain?
066	I've merely seen him from afar on the battlefield when I was still a rookie. But even now, I can't forget that malicious, murderous vibe.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
067	The winds are telling me she's near, but I can't see a trace of her. We have to assume she's quite skilled.
068	Wind artists are quite troublesome.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
069	?!
070	It's not my intention to fight you.<br>Could you not give it up?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
071	You little scoundrel!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
072	Wait! We should not approach her carelessly! I'm getting some sort of dangerous vibe from her!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
073	That's exactly why we should attack her! Let's beat her at once, before she can even unleash that power! Doesn't that sound reasonable?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
074	I don't know what she's plotting at, but the future of the Holy Guard could depend on this too! Excuse me, but I'm going to have you take a little nap!
075	Huh?!<br>What's the meaning of this?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
076	She stopped a captain's blow with such a small body?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
077	Oh, that aggressive spirit oozing from the axe! So that's what's going on!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
078	I'm sorry, but please take a little nap.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
079	Whah?!<br>Arghh!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
080	Captain Monzein!!!
081	Let me repeat myself.<br>If possible, I don't want to fight you people.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
082	U-ugh!<br>T-take care, Seida! It's Zahar!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
083	Huh?!
084	I can sense Zahar's malicious vibe from this girl!
085	This girl is in some way or another utilizing Zahar's soul!
086	Please don't use the word “utilizing.”	VO_spica.spica_sys_0029
087	I've been keeping Lord Zahar's protection stone on me at all time, and he's protecting me through that.
088	You're talking about a Philosopher's Stone?! What a malicious presence!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
089	Even if Zahar's will is in this stone, I can't believe it could have such an impact!
090	No, even if she's had this stone with her continuously, it couldn't possess such an energy!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
091	I suspect that Zahar must have imbued that Philosopher's Stone with dark powers!
092	A Philosopher's Stone imbued with Zahar's malicious dark powers?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
093	Malicious, you say? I cannot allow you to blaspheme Lord Zahar like that.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0012
094	Shadow Messiah...
095	...!
096	I-I heard about that. How he fled from the Holy Guard, to disappear from the main stage.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
097	And how he proceeded to gather the best of Wratharis to form an elite corps. You must be part of that corps, aren't you?!
098	An elite corps formed by Zahar?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
