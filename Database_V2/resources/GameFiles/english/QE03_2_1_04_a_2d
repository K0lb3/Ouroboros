003	I understand Alchemy is a forbidden power–that it is a sin to wield it.
004	But it is the Holy Guard who must decide on the verdict for one who has obtained this power. For the Royal Palace to take over this role...and in secret...

007	In any case, I will not stand to see my friend killed because of this!
008	Ack. I-if I had a choice, of course I wouldn't want to be involved in harming my own student.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0042
