001	Monzein...ack! If only you had lent an ear to what I was telling you...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
002	!!!
003	All right stop. That's enough.
004	Captain Kudan...now, now, don't you think you're going a little too far?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0003
005	It's really not funny anymore.
006	Othima...you too?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
007	So scary! I told you not to stare at me with those frightening eyes of yours.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
008	Get out of the way, Othima, or else you'll end up getting hurt.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0013
009	Mm. Not likely. After all, the world's future is in the balance, and I am a knight of justice after all.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
010	I see. Don't blame me if you end up regretting that choice.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0037
011	Oh dear... You've become quite consumed by the darkness. You really did take the easy route.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0046
012	The easy route...?
013	Come now, don't get worked up. Because of our current situation, let me tell you this...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
014	You really shouldn't go any further. You don't wanna get swallowed up by the darkness, do you, captain?
015	The darkness...what do you mean?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
016	Captain Kudan...The Alchemia within you is too strong.
017	On top of that, I heard that you have the potential to be easily swayed by darkness. It's a little dangerous to have the Mikaboshi–with all its hidden power–near you.
018	Easily swayed by darkness? Me...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
019	I don't know the details, but, according to Lord Zain, your past plays a role in this.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
020	I don't know what kind of flawed conclusion you reached, but...
021	The reason why Lord Zain ordered you to stay back was out of a parental desire to prevent you from being consumed by the darkness. Don't misunderstand his intentions.
022	In any case, I'll ask Zain myself. Move out of the way. I don't have time for this.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
023	No can do.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0039
024	In that case, I'll have to get past you by force. Don't take this personally!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
025	You should not turn aside the belief that Lord Zain has in you...that we all have in you.
026	I'm going to stop you here. Please don't hate me for it.
027	Shut up!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
028	Agh...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
029	I'm sorry... This is entity Ill Atmosphere!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
030	Agh...!!!
031	Captain Kudan...let's end it now. If you apologize, everyone will forgive you.
032	...?! ...Gaah!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
033	Ug-ugff...! He-he's so fast!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0028
034	Don't...get...in...my...way...
035	N-no...Captain Kudan! Th-that's too much...! Ugff!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0028
036	Hmph...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
037	Is Zain up ahead?
038	Gggh...! Argh...seriously?! That aura...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
039	The Holy Guard's coat of arms was found at Chihaya's assassination scene. How could that be?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
040	At the very least...this means that there's a liar within the Holy Guard.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0017
041	No way...?! Are you trying to say that Chihaya was killed by the Holy Guard?!
042	Perhaps it was the woman right next to you who was behind it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
043	You scum! Are you gonna try to blame my mistress?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0029
044	No...you're right...I...killed her.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
045	What?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
046	So it was you after all!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
047	When I heard that she had been assassinated, I knew in my heart...I had been the one who had killed her.
048	If I had not let her go back to Wadatsumi then...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
049	When I parted ways with Chihaya...I should have pulled her arm and kept her with me!
050	She was right there next to me! I was in a position to protect her from the tragedy that befell her!
051	Mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
052	I cannot deny your words. I am responsible as well!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
053	I just stood by and let her die!
054	No! You shouldn't hold yourself responsible, mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0027
055	You're just like Kudanstein.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
056	Huh...?
057	You're also being played like a puppet...without even knowing the real truth.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
058	Reimei! Ack! What are you doing?!
059	Played...?
060	Mistress?
061	I don't know the real truth?
