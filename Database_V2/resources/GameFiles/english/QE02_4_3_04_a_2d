001	You killed the old man!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
002	Weren't you listening? Edward ended his own life by ignoring my instructions.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0003
003	More importantly...he did ultimately end up falling off a cliff.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
004	Tsk. You've given another reason for me to beat you to a pulp.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
005	What...?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0005
006	You made the little lady cry. Whatever the case, there'll be no forgiveness for you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
007	Hmph. What a small-minded man.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
008	What did you say...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
009	Look and see the black cloudy sky. This is all the product of human greed and lethargy.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0030
010	This a clear indication that humans are an evil in this world.
011	And are you trying to say that you're the Messiah–the savior?
012	Yes. It will finally begin...the cleansing of all evil.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
013	This vile race called humanity will disappear from this world!
014	Jeez. Looks like you've been completely taken over by the Messiah.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
015	Sorry. I don't necessarily hate our vile race.
016	Another thing: I'm gonna be taking back the Belphegor that's asleep inside you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
