001	Lord Zain.
002	Kagura, I'm glad to see you've returned.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
003	When I was coming this way, I heard some talk. Is it true that the Mikaboshi was found in Wadatsumi?
004	Unfortunately, it is.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
005	I see. I didn't think it was real. I thought it was a fairytale.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
006	‘Mikaboshi filled with fierce Chakras<br>wielding power, what shapes reality<br>whisking our warrior where we won't follow...'
007	So you've heard about that legend surrounding Wadatsumi.
008	Yes. I was surprised when I researched it. It almost seems to depict a Sacred Stone opening the Door of Truth.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
009	It's a silly story. It's hard to imagine such a dangerous power lying dormant within Wadatsumi.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
010	However, according to the report from our investigative unit, the Alchemia contained with the discovered Mikaboshi is equivalent to that of a Sacred Stone.
011	What?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
012	The authenticity of such legends aside, the fact is the Mikaboshi exists and is as powerful as a Sacred Stone.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
013	If such a power were to fall into the hands of evil, who knows what will happen to the world.
014	You're going to destroy it immediately, right?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
015	Yes. For that reason, I had you hurry back.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
016	What do you mean? Will I be moving separately from everyone else? Is this some kind of special mission?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0026
017	Well, you're sort of half right.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
018	Lord Zain?! Why are you unsheathing your sword?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
019	What? A monster?!
020	... ...
021	Wh-what is going on?! Did you bring in these monsters, Lord Zain?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0028
022	Eeek!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0042
