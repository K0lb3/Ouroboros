001	Her Highness the queen will see you!
002	It's about time. Have you told her of my business here?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
003	The Holy Guard is fully responsible for the disposal of Alchemy and all Sacred Stones.
004	I wish for information regarding this country's Sacred Stone Asmodeus and the handing over of the man who brought Belphegor into this country.
005	Also, I wish for the disposal of that girl who has awoken to Alchemy.
006	...What are you playing at?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
007	The Holy Guard...no, the Corpse... You are not in this country right now.
008	... ...
009	Dias Elysion never came to Lustburg.
010	That will be the one truth that remains in this kingdom.
011	Hmph. I thought as much. I'm used to that kind of stupidity from humans.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
012	Wh-what is this?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
013	The Bugmail...they've changed their direction towards the Roya Palace.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
014	They couldn't even take down our school, but now they're advancing towards the entrance of the Royal Palace. They must have some kind of trump card.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
015	In any case...let's stop them!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
016	Die!!!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_battle_0015
017	Agh... I don't have time for these insects!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
018	Wait!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
019	Lisbeth?! Why? I thought you had been seized in the school!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
020	Never mind that; don't kill the insect! This insect was once a man who was loved by someone...right?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
021	What nonsense are you...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
022	Who are these prattling brats?! Let's take them all out right now!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0012
023	Lisbeth! You will be executed here!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0013
024	Things are getting pretty messy!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0021
025	We've no allies anywhere!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0020
026	We can...increase our allies!
