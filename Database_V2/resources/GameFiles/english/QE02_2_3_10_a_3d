001	Ethan?! Ethan, are you there?!
002	Fiona! Get down, aye!
003	...!
004	Ethan, be careful! Get down!
005	Ack! It's too bad you're an android. That arm of yours is quite something!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
006	Right back at you. You continue to deflect my shots.
007	Plus...your unparalleled ability to return fire is nothing short of brilliant.
008	Without my armor, I would've been defeated long ago.
009	Jeez. Don't sound so surprised. I've been a gunslinger much longer than you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
010	I regret having to take you out, but it cannot be helped. It's my mission.
011	...!
012	Reflex speed set to max. It will be impossible for you to deflect my shots now. I'll finish you off here.
013	Tsk! Alkemono...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
014	Aye, what is it?
015	If something happens to me...
016	Take Ethan and the little lady, and jump out of the window into the river. That'll give you all a chance of surviving this.
017	Edgar...?!
018	It's pathetic really...but it's all I can do to hold this Alkaroid at bay.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
019	To be honest, if it increases its speed any further, I don't know what'll happen.
020	Th-that Alkaroid is that strong?!
021	Yep. Unfortunately, I'm at the end of my rope. 
022	...That's why you should've accepted the power!
023	Huh...? The power...?
024	Aye! If you'd accepted the power at the Door of Truth, you could've easily defeated this Alkaroid, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0016
025	The Door of Truth...?
026	Tsk. What are you saying at a time like this?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
027	I'd never place my future in the hands of an unknown power.
028	Are you finished talking? Let's go, gunslinger!
029	Edgar!
030	You got to pave your own path using your own power, or there's no point in living.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
031	Come, android! I'll pave my own path with my own hands!!!
