001	Too much time has passed. No one seems to be emerging. Has something happened inside?
002	... ...
003	Huff...huff...!
004	You're one of the Paladins! What's wrong? Why are you covered in wounds?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
005	Ack...	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
006	What happened?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
007	Ughh...Ch-Chloe...was kidnapped by a knight from Wra-Wratharis...called Zahar!
008	!!!
009	Was he...in the ruins?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
010	Zahar is trying to start a war with the...Holy Order of Babel! We need to stop him quickly!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
011	!!!
012	Very well. We'll stop him before that happens. You rest here.
013	...No...
014	What?
015	Please take me with you! I want to help Chloe!
016	This is now a matter to be handled by official Paladins. There's no place for Squires.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
017	No! Chloe saved me time and again! I want to do whatever I can to save her!
018	Even if it means risking your own life?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0024
019	I want to protect her! I promised her on my honor as a knight!!!
020	Your honor as a knight, huh? Very well. I permit you to accompany us.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0037
021	R-really?! Thank...you!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
022	Listen, Paladins! We, the Holy Guard, advance forward to capture the rebels of Wratharis!
023	We must save our fellow Paladin and protect the peace within Babel!
024	We, the Scarlet Flame Guard, will also follow suit! We cannot forsake our comrade from Envylia!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
025	Hold on, Chloe! I'll do everything I can to rescue you!
026	Ca-Captain Cadanova!
027	Huh? The Flame Dragon King Cadanova?! Agh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
028	Know this. Honorless men have no right to wield a sword.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_chara_0002
029	Um...Captain Cadanova!
030	What is it?
031	Captain...did you know that Zahar used to be a Paladin?
032	I've heard he was once next in line to be captain of the Holy Guard. 	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
033	No way! I...don't understand it!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
034	Understand what?
035	Well, the Holy Guard is supposed to be a body of knights that protect justice, right?
036	Then why would someone next in line to be their captain do something like this?
037	Kanon, wasn't it? Justice...is a difficult concept.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
038	Huh? Justice?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
039	Over the past few months, Captain Vettel of the Scarlet Flame Guard had been picking up on a disturbance within Envylia.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
040	In Envylia?
041	However, they were up against the powerful knight Zahar, once next in line to be captain of the Holy Guard.
042	While following his trail, numerous Knights of the Scarlet Flame Guard were defeated.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
043	Taking this threat seriously, the Holy Order of Babel requested the assistance of the Holy Guard. Thus, as captain of the 4th Regiment, I was dispatched.
044	Did you know that Zahar would show up during our final trial?
045	I wasn't certain.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
046	With the possibility that he might show up in a place where the Holy Guard and the Scarlet Flame Guard were gathered, we waited here just in case.
047	However, we hadn't anticipated him setting up an ambush within the Trial Ruins.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0012
048	I had no idea all of that was taking place during our graduation trial.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
049	I don't know why Zahar is attempting to start a war against the Holy Order of Babel.
050	However, wars begin due to conflicting interpretations of justice.
051	Conflicting interpretations...of justice...
052	Kanon, carrying out your own justice is no simple task. Do you think you can do it?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
053	My own justice...
054	A sword without justice becomes nothing more than a tool for murder. Don't forget that.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
055	Y-yes, Captain!
056	Um...Captain Vettel?
057	You're...Kanon, right? What's the matter?
058	U-um...there's something I wanted to ask you!
059	What is it?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
060	Why did Zahar cause an incident like this?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
061	He said that you were his "nemesis"!
062	If you know anything, please tell me! I want to save Chloe!
063	Right. Well, I believe that Zahar...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
064	may have felt threatened by the rise of Envylia,
065	after its independence from Wratharis.
066	The rise of Envylia?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
067	That's why he quit the Holy Guard and returned to his own country, dedicating himself to enhancing his own Alchemy.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
068	Now, he's gone so far as to extract Alchemia Particles from young Paladins at the Trial Ruins.
069	Was that...to protect Wratharis too?
070	I'm not sure. Neither Alchemy in itself, nor the power it provides, will allow you to change anything.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
071	Captain Vettel...
072	But it's all right! I'll stop him!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
073	I want to show him how foolish he is to rely on Alchemy.
074	U-um, Ca-Captain Vettel!
075	Hm?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
076	Chloe is a great knight with a lot of potential! She is honorable and loves the Kingdom of Envylia! That's why...um...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
077	I understand. We'll rescue her at all costs.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
078	Th-thank you!
