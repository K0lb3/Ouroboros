001	Ack... I won't give up.	VO_sakura.sakura_battle_0028
002	I'm not back down. If I am defeated, then that's that.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_battle_0013
003	Captain Vettel...what should we do?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_1028
004	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Tyr, Chloe, Sakura. This world is going to be eradicated.
005	Is there nothing we can do?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
006	Beyond here is a world where the three worlds you have traveled to temporarily overlap.
007	There you just might be able to fulfill that ambitious desire of yours.
008	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have wished for it. I should've stayed alone.
009	Ohh... This world is about to collapse. Everything will be consumed and eradicated...all because of what I wished for.
010	I should...just die.
011	Don't give up! Rena!
012	It's okay, Rena! I finally know how I can help you!
013	I understand why it had to be here. It's all thanks to you, <p_name>.
014	The three worlds overlap here! It's because you brought them together, <p_name>!
015	Rena! This is where you can sever your past!
016	Let's go, Tyr! Sakura! Let's release Rena from her loneliness!
017	That's the spirit! Rena! We're heading to you now!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0008
