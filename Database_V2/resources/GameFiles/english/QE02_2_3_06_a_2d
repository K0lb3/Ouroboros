001	Tsk! They're a tenacious bunch, aren't they!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
002	Aye, these Alkaroid's are the AJ1000 model!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
003	No need to explain. Fighting them tells me everything I need to know.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
004	That being said, with all the security measure they've placed on this compartment...
005	There's no doubt that's where Ethan is being held!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_005
006	Yep. I'm certain as well.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
007	Jeez. I don't want to admit it, but the Beckrams use incredible technology. It's amazing.
008	But...there is no soul there.
009	If you compare Alkemono with those androids the difference is obvious.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
010	Of course! Androids should live in harmony and assist mankind.
011	The Beckrams' philosophy is completely different than ours. We believe that people's lifestyles should be the priority!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
012	Unlike the Beckrams, who believe in prioritizing profit.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	For the Beckrams, androids are nothing more than tools–products.
014	They believe there is no soul within them. After all, a soul is something they've never sought from their creations.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
015	They believe a machine has no need of a soul.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
016	But I think that's a very dangerous way of thinking!
017	How can people believe that, as long as it's a machine, it can be treated horribly and abused for the purpose of self-gain?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
018	That way of thinking will eventually rob us of our humanity!
019	I feel like once this idea penetrates society, people will begin to forget who they are!
020	It's crucial that those who deal with machines must have the correct mindset and philosophy.
021	The Beckrams way of thinking will never bring about true abundance to this country!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
022	Heh. If your old man could see you now. He'd be crying tears of joy.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
023	Oh! So-sorry...I...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
024	You don't have to apologize.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
025	Jeez. Thanks to your strong determination, it's given me a newfound will.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
026	Aye, you moved us!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0027
027	The Sacred Stone Belphegor really should belong to you, little lady.
028	We've no time to waste here. Hold on tight!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
