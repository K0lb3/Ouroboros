001	If you can promise me that you'll kill this Kudanstein, then I'll try restoring Excalibur.
002	Huh?!
003	Kill Captain Kudanstein?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
004	I cannot make that promise.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
005	And why is that? Isn't he the criminal who caused the rebellion, in your eyes?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
006	But... Captain Kudanstein is also an important comrade to us.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
007	I think he just went a little bit astray. 
008	Astray? Do you really think that could ever conclude the matter?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0016
009	No, I don't. But still, I can't possibly believe that killing Captain Kudanstein could be the right answer.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
010	I believe I can get my feelings across to him as well. As long as he doesn't realize and face his errors, I don't think it would be a true atonement.
011	Is that your judgment as the Lord Commander?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
012	It's not just me.
013	I think Lord Zain would have agreed with me.
014	Zain... really?
015	This is what he told me just before he died...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
016	“I am sure that the Light in you has the power to return Kudanstein back from the darkness.”
017	Until his final moments, Lord Zain wanted to straighten Captain Kudan's errors, to bring him back on the right path.
018	I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted revenge.
019	Geez, how naive can you be. Reality doesn't really work with that kind of idealism.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
020	Miuna...
021	But... I probably would have continued adoring him for sticking to his ideals like that. Alright then. Follow me.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
022	Huh?
023	The sacred tools required for restoring Excalibur are slumbering in the sanctuary close to the crater ahead.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
024	I mean to say...<br>Because those two put their trust in you, I might as well do the same.
025	T-thank you so much!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
026	Shadow Messiah, the elite corps formed by Zahar?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
027	Tsk... you're probably also one of those assassins, targeting key figures for the sake of reviving Wratharis.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
028	It's true that I was part of them.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
029	But I didn't necessarily agree with the organization's ideals.
030	Then... why were you part of the organization?
031	I just wanted to be close to Lord Zahar, that's all.
032	You wanted to be close to Zahar?<br>But why?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
033	Why, you ask?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
034	I suppose you're asking me for the reason why I wanted to be close to Lord Zahar...
035	That's something which is very difficult for me to explain.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0031
036	Phuh! We're asking you what you hoped to attain from being close to Zahar!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
037	Apart from being close to Zahar, there was nothing else I wanted to obtain.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
038	Merely serving Lord Zahar gave me happiness.
039	Happiness?<br>Being together with that malicious murderer made you happy?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
040	It's true that he had a chaotic temperament, and that often got him misunderstood.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
041	But Lord Zahar was not just a cruel knight.
042	He only seemed that way to others due to his unique sense of justice. So please stop calling him that.
043	Are you serious?! What are you even talking about?! Zahar was just greedy for power, filled with egocentric ambition, trying to rule the world!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
044	I saw him with my own eyes, and felt his malicious presence with my own skin. He's not the kind of guy you say!
045	No, Lord Zahar was not what you think.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0012
046	It's a fact after all that Lord Zahar saved my life.
047	Zahar saved your life?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
048	I was originally born and raised as a daughter of a wealthy noble house of Wratharis.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
049	But by the time I was old enough to understand, something happened that changed everything.
050	What was that?
051	A certain organization that was after the Sacred Stone of Wratharis assassinated countless key figures of the state.
052	My family too... everyone was murderer by their assassins.
053	A certain organization, you say?
054	I'm talking about you guys; the Holy Guard.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
055	What?!
056	In order to avoid future revenge, these members of the Holy Guard were apparently ordered to kill my whole family.
057	When their assassins approached me, I was prepared to die as well.
058	One of their knights however, came to stand in in front of me to protect me.
059	And that was Zahar?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
060	Yes.<br>At that time, Lord Zahar was still part of the Holy Guard.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
061	Lord Zahar, who was the leader of this squad, ordered the others to search the mansion, thus saving my life.
062	Was that mission really an order from the Holy Guard's central command?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
063	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
064	Zahar must have been acting by himself, faking the Holy Guard's command.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
065	He's the type of guy who'd use any method to reach his goals. It's not unthinkable.
066	So what?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
067	Huh?
068	Even if that were true, it's still a fact that Lord Zahar saved my life.
069	Whatever you may say about him, my adoration for him will never change.
070	Do you even know what you're saying? Zahar may be the one who took your family from you, you know?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
071	It's useless.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
072	Whatever we may say, she probably won't take it into consideration.
073	Exactly.<br>So, would you move away now?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
074	Wait, we're not done talking.<br>So, your objective must be...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
075	not Excalibur, but the ones who killed Zahar; Kanon and Chloe?
076	Lord Zahar also paid a lot of attention to Excalibur, so I'm quite fascinated by the Holy Sword as well, but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0005
077	my primary interest is the existence of those two.
078	In that case, I cannot let you go.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
079	Even though Kanon told me not to hurt you.
080	But having heard your intentions, I won't be able to abide by that.
081	I'm sorry, but I'll have to stop you!
082	You're going to... attack me?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
083	I don't think you're a bad person...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
084	but even if you weren't... as long as you're after our Lord Commander's life, I cannot let you do as you please!
085	Wait, Seida!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
086	She told you not to hurt me?<br>I see...
087	?!<br>The Philosopher's Stone is acting as a defense barrier?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
088	I'm sorry, but I cannot be wasting my time here.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
089	Ugh! We won't let you!<br>Whoaaaa!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
090	Z-Zahar?!<br>Ugh! D-darn it!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
091	M-my body doesn't move!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0029
092	Why don't you stay like that for the time being.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
093	?!<br>You're not going to strike at us?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
094	That's not the issue here!<br>Darn it, Kanon is in danger!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
