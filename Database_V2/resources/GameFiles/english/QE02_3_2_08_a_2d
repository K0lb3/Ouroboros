001	Lord Alvarez...we've received a report. It wasn't the gunslinger who abducted Miss Fiona...but the previously mentioned mercenary.
002	...So things have finally been set into motion.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
003	Did you expect this development?
004	In order to deceive your enemies, start with your allies. That's the human way of thinking.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
005	He appears to have come in search of the Sacred Stone...
006	So I thought it best to find out more about him.
007	Never mind. Leave him loose for now. Meanwhile, run a thorough investigation on his identity.
008	Yes, sir.
009	W-wait...! Lord Alvarez, there's an intruder!
010	An intruder? Don't treat me as if I were some small-time criminal.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0017
011	Oh? Well, isn't this a welcoming guest.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0024
012	You should train your men better. If I wanted it, you'd be dead by now.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
013	I expect better from you.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0007
014	That being said, it could be troublesome for someone in my position to be seen with the boss of the underworld.
015	Nonsense. I know you'll be able to crush any rumors of this scale from getting out.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
016	People don't even know about the train bombing, do they?
017	I called on you countless times, yet you never came. What are you doing here now?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0016
018	Don't tell me that you're now considering lending me a hand.
019	Well...I came here to see what you're made of.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
020	What I'm made of?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0005
021	I've gotten to where I am through with the debt that I owe the former mayor...
022	That being said, it suddenly dawned on me that I don't know what your aim is.
023	Every individual believes in their own form of justice.
024	Without knowing what you truly stand for, judging you based on my own preconceived perspective prevents me from making any true judgment.
025	I see. So you wish to listen to what I have to say?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0024
026	Something like that. What will happen to this world if it were entrusted to you?
027	Heh. If my ideal world were to come to fruition...	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
028	All the evil that is rampant in this world will be wiped out!
029	Are you talking about the Don Taras Family and me?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
030	No...I respect your position. How about we join forces?
031	Forget about something so insignificant as the head of the mafia...
032	I promise you a position of much larger power.
033	Unfortunately...I'm really not interested in things like that.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
034	So you want to wipe out all evil, huh? In other words, only justice will remain in the world?
035	Yes. All meaningless sorrow will disappear. It will be a world of absolute ideals.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
036	My justice will bring perfect peace to this world. 
037	I see. Well...thanks for your time.
038	Wait... What do you mean?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0001
039	The world is a hot mess of good and evil. That's the way it's supposed to be.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
040	Mayor Edward, who I loved and respected, tried to accept everything as it was.
041	Your ideal world is...pathetic in comparison.
042	Let's go, Tango.
043	...!	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0027
044	I will wipe out all evil from this world...including you.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0017
