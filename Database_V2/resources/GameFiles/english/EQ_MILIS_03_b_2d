001	I-I thought we were gonna die!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0030
002	I'm not sure I would've survived on my own. Thank you, Milis.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0033
003	The feeling is mutual! But why was that black thing here?
004	Most likely, it was here to protect the relic that had been placed here–the one on top of the altar.
005	Is this a book?
006	It looks like it. Let's see its contents–
007	...!
008	What's the matter, Lofy?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
009	No. It's nothing. It seems like this book is something extremely important to Lustburg.
010	Really?! That's good!
011	Thanks, Milis. You saved me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0034
012	Eheh.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
013	Come on. Let's return to Lustburg. We need to report about these ruins.
014	Also, I'm sure the knights scattered here would like to return home as well.
015	This concludes my report.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0004
016	Well, well. I see.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0045
017	I've heard your report, Court Mage Lofia. We will investigate this case.
018	Putting that aside, we must give you a reward that is appropriate for the work you've accomplished.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
019	What? We're gonna get paid?!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0012
020	Of course. The country cannot make advancements if we do not reward fine work.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0037
021	We did it, Lofy!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0009
022	Yeah.
023	...Lofy?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
024	Is there a problem?
025	Hoho! Not in the least! I see, I see!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
026	Court Mage Lofia, do cherish your friends. They are a treasure of a lifetime!
027	...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
028	Lofy, why is your face red?
029	It's nothing. More importantly, the promise we made...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
030	Huh? Did we make a promise?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0047
031	About eating together.
032	Oh, that's right! Now that we've got pocket money let's go crazy!
033	Wow. There are still so many sweets I don't know about! Hey, Lofy, what do you want to eat?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0023
034	More importantly, what's in this plate? Why is it in front of me?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
035	Huh? I promised you, didn't I? That water lizard cuisine!
036	This is food? I heard there was a dish called Otsukuri in Wadatsumi, but...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
037	Otsu...kuri? Never heard of food like that.
038	There's so much that I don't know about.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
039	You can learn little by little.
040	By the way, what are you doing in Lustburg, Milis?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
041	Huh? Oh, well, my grandma sent me on an errand and–
042	...
043	I-I completely forgot!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0028
044	Hey, Lofy! Is there something called Venus School of Magic around here?!
045	Calm down, Milis! You're spilling cream!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0020
046	Is that really all your errands? Have you forgotten something?
047	No, that's everything! It's all thanks to you being acquainted with the high-ups here in Lustburg, Lofy!
048	I've never heard of someone forgetting the reason why they came to this city.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0030
049	W-well, I was so hungry!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0011
050	Eheh. I ended up relying on you until the end.
051	I gotta go home.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0022
052	...I see.
053	Are you sad?
054	I didn't say that...
055	I am. I can't believe that I have to say goodbye to you here, Lofy.
056	...
057	So this is goodbye. Yes. I'm sure this will be the last time we meet.
058	I'll come again to this city!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0041
059	When I do, let's eat sweets together again, okay? Next time I'll tell you all about my homeland!
060	Oh, that's right! You also need to teach me to become a gentlewoman like you, Lofy.
061	There's so much we've gotta do together!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
062	I'm looking forward to it.
063	If that were actually possible, it would make me happy as well. But...
064	Yes. I'm looking forward to it too! I'll see you then! I promise–promise!–to come and see you!
065	If you have any problems, just tell me! I'll always take your side, Lofy.
066	...Thanks.
067	See you soon, Lofy!
068	See yaaa!
069	Bye bye, Milis!
070	But I can't meet you again. I can't afford to let you get involved any further.
071	That all seems like a distant memory.
072	It's been a while since I've come to eat that special chiffon cake from that day.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
073	...
074	I wonder if Milis came to see me today as well.
075	I gave Michael the nasty job of turning her away every time she came.
076	I wish I could see her at least one last time. But...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0020
077	But I can't let her get involved any further.
078	I can't tell anyone about the information written within the book recovered from the ruins.
079	I can't believe that the Sacred Stone Asmodeus contained such a secret.
080	If I don't protect it, this country will...
081	...Oh.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
082	You're Court Mage Lofia, correct?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
083	A Paladin? Here in the center of the city?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
084	To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.
085	That means your aim is to...!
086	You've uncovered too much. I'm going to silence you. Forever.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
087	Huh?! Oh, blood! Eeek! Someone help!
088	O-ohh...	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0021
089	Ahaha. I doubt I'm surviving this one.
090	I was planning on visiting sweet shops across the city today. I guess not being able to do that is my only regret.
091	Now that the other side has made such a bold move, the Court Mage Order will be on guard as well. That means the country will be okay.
092	The promise we made..that's my other regret.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0011
093	Yes. I'm looking forward to it too! I'll see you then! I promise–promise!–to come and see you!
094	If you have any problems, just tell me! I'll always take your side, Lofy.
095	It doesn't look like I can keep my promise.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0010
096	I'm sorry, Milis.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0011
