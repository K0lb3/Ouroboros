001	Tsk! What is up with these monsters?! Compared to the ones I've encountered until now, they're on another level!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
002	You should watch your back as well. These monsters tend to hide their presence.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0001
003	Agh! Of course, I know that! Don't state the obvious!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
004	I see. I apologize for my unnecessary actions.
005	Damn it! Saved by a Paladin!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
006	As one who wields the art, you should understand the level of their abilities.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
007	These Paladins are the result of extensive research and training.
008	The techniques of these elite, gathered from all across the continent, are second to none.
009	Lord Gabirond, are they that impressive? Even the Wratharis Alchemist that I took down—	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
010	They cannot wield the art without Philosopher's Stones. Will you compare us to those rebels?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
011	You must have realized. Not one of the Paladins possesses a Philosopher's Stone.
012	Of course. But, I don't either.
013	True. You appear to possess some degree of talent.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
014	However, it is yet to be seen if you have as many Alchemia Particles as a Paladin.
015	Alchemia Particles? Do you mean particles from the Philosopher's Stones?
016	Your studies appear to be insufficient regarding the mechanics of the art.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
017	All that have lived within the continent of Babel's long history possess Alchemia Particles within their body.
018	Amongst them, there will rarely appear one who possesses an outstanding amount, allowing them to wield the art without a Philosopher's Stone.
019	And they're the Holy Guard?
020	Indeed. The Holy Guard is an institution made up of those from across the continent that possess an extraordinary amount of Alchemia Particles.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
021	They are a selected breed, possessing raw qualities that separate them from others.
022	A selected breed...
