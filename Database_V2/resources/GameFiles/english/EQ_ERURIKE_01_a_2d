001	I didn't expect things to end up like this.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0030
002	You're too loud. Try to be more aware of your surroundings. If that ‘thing' were to find us here, we'd have nowhere to escape to.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
003	Ack... I know, I know.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0029
004	Seriously. I've picked up quite the handful.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0030
005	Thank you. You really helped me.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
006	I would prefer if you apologized instead of thanking me.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
007	We're gonna keep walking until the sun sets. Don't lag behind.
008	I know, I know!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
009	Hey, Elrike! I just got back...whoa?!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0003
010	What is this mess?! It's like a hurricane just blasted through this room!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0029
011	Oh, Elaine? You got back safely! Sorry. Hold on a second.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
012	I still haven't organized my luggage from when I went on my trip to Lustburg.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0036
013	Don't worry about it. You really do like traveling, don't you?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0030
014	You were just telling me the other day, when you came back from Slothstein, that you wouldn't travel for a while after being ridiculed and having your pockets picked.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0001
015	Now that's nothing more than a good memory. Traveling as a merchant is my life's passion!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
016	It's a wonderful thing to experience the culture of a new place and then share their local food and traditional goods with other lands.
017	So I guess I can't be stopped that easily. The same could be said about your work, Elaine. You won't quit, even when I tell you it's dangerous.
018	Being a mercenary is never a risk-free job, although I do I get your point.
019	Anyway, I'm determined to show my little baby a lot of different places.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0045
020	Oh! You mean your hat! You're still using it?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0027
021	Of course! She carries a lot of important memories with her.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
022	When I was a child, I was so weak I couldn't even play outside.
023	You used to go on all sorts of adventures with that hat and then come back to tell me about them.
024	You have no idea how much that meant to a bed-ridden child like me.
025	That's why there's no way I can get rid of this hat.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
026	Don't keep telling me that story. It makes me feel embarrassed.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0048
027	You don't have to be embarrassed! It's the truth.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0008
028	Besides...thanks in part to that, I was able to find my passion in life.
029	What do you mean?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0047
030	I mean that I was happy trading my sweets for stories of your adventures, Elaine.
031	I was so envious of you traveling around in that hat and looking for freedom and adventures.
032	I remember begging you for the hat because I thought it would give me the strength to leap out of bed and go traveling as well.
033	Ahahah. I remember that.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0008
034	You told me that you were willing to exchange it for something that you truly wanted.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
035	I searched desperately to find something you could value, Elaine.
036	When you finally agreed to exchange your hat for one that was dear to me...
037	I remember feeling so happy to see the smile on your face. It made me realize the pure joy of finding something that someone else values.
038	Hehe. Well, it's true that no amount of money would've made me part with that. The only person that I've exchanged one of my hats with...	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0007
039	...is you, Elrike.
040	Still, I'm surprised to see how someone as fragile as you has now become a trader who travels all across the continent.
041	It makes me feel a little emotional.
042	Heheh. If you were to go by just distance alone, I've now journeyed much further than you, Elaine.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0010
043	True. I wonder how that modest little highborn lady turned out like this.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0016
044	I'm still a lovely lady! Also, I'm older than you so try to be more respectful.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
045	Hmm. That's not really my style.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0030
046	Seriously!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0050
047	Oh, more importantly...did you hear that Gluttony Foss has been making an effort to procure supplies?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0031
048	This is quite well known amongst my fellow mercenaries, but it seems like some kind of conflict is brewing.
049	Is that true?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
050	Yep, yep.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0004
051	Because of that, all the notorious mercenaries have made their way there making it difficult to find good people to hire here.
052	... ...
053	...?
054	If they're going to consume more, then of course supplies will sell better, right? Especially Envylia supplies since the desert between the two countries makes trade difficult.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0031
055	All right. I think I'll pay them a visit!
056	Hey, are you sure you're taking this seriously?! A regular trip is one thing, but you're gonna have to bring a lot of stuff if you're gonna trade.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0025
057	Do you know how long it'll take to prepare a horse for starters?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0002
058	I've got it all planned out. I know more than a few merchants who would lend me their horse on a moment's notice!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0038
059	Sigh... You're well-connected as usual.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0030
060	Well, I'm a merchant. Getting along with people...no, bringing people together is also part of my job.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0010
061	It's your hobby as well, right?
062	Hehe. It's more than a hobby. Meeting new people is a once-in-a-lifetime chance that's worth its weight in gold.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
063	Besides, since I'll be mostly just checking things out this time, I'm going to try and negotiate for a caravan headed towards Gluttony to take me with them.
064	A caravan, huh? I think you trust others a little too much...	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0030
065	Faith and trust are the most important assets that a merchant can have.
066	Yeah, yeah. I've heard that over and over again.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0004
067	But be careful, all right? I've heard rumors that pirates are targeting merchants more and more these days.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0001
068	Seriously. You're such a worrier, Elaine...whoops, gotta hurry. I need to catch an early caravan!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0050
069	Fine, fine. Be safe!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0005
070	Got it. I'm off then!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
071	Umm. First I'll arrange for a horse cart...oh, before that, I need to find a caravan that is headed to Gluttony.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0031
072	Huh? The city gates seem really busy. I wonder if a large caravan just arrived.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
073	Oh, young lady, are you a merchant as well?
074	Yes. I'm planning on crossing the desert from now and heading to Gluttony Foss. Did something happen?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
075	Ah. Are you headed there too? Actually, I was planning on heading there myself, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
076	I'm not very well informed about the trade route to Gluttony. The desert lies between, right?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
077	Right now, there's talk about a large group of bandits showing up. Although, I'm sure there were a lot of them to begin with.
078	Bandits?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
079	It seems like they've ended their skirmishes with the locals and have taken in some of the mercenaries who are desperate for food.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
080	Quite a large number of travelers and merchants have fallen victim. The leaders of Gluttony have finally been spurred into action.
081	Do you mean that the Guild Guard has been summoned to take care of them?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
082	No, no. If Gluttony were to send out soldiers to the outskirts of the border...that, more than anything, would lead to war.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0047
083	Instead, they've sent the Guild as they are familiar with the desert. Can you see them?
084	Seriously. What a hassle.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0029
085	Is that the representative from the Guild?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0031
086	That's Ryle, the man of luck. Don't you know him? He's really famous around these parts. Apparently, he's the one who'll be leading this caravan.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0005
087	People are relieved by his presence, so a lot of them are joining the guild's caravan.
088	Can anyone join this caravan?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0044
089	Yeah. Apparently, they've also been tasked with protecting the merchants. Of course, Gluttony will be paying for the costs. So we'll be moving as one big family.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
090	(Gluttony will be paying?!)	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
091	(Also, from what I can see, even the rental supply wagons seem to be expensive. Isn't that a Slothstein-made Alchemic wagon?)
092	If I join this caravan, I'll be able to save a lot in costs. Heheh.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
093	Dad, have you finished talking? I'm hungry.
094	You just ate. Honestly, we've got a long trip ahead so try to endure a little more.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
095	But...
096	Hey, little fellow. Do you like fruits?
097	Huh? Oh, you're gonna give it to me?! Thank you, lady!
098	Ah. Sorry about that.
099	Not at all. It's my way of saying thank you for all the information you've given me. After all, information is a valuable trades good.
100	You've got quite the skillful tongue on you, young lady. I hope we both do well in our trading.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
101	Yes!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
102	We'll begin moving now! Those accompanying us, fall in line! Make sure to place your supplies on the shared wagons!
103	Oh, looks like we're gonna start moving now. You should hurry, young lady.
104	Ah, right!
105	We're being attacked! Here come the bandits!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
106	Prepare for battle! Don't let them close to the supplies...agh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
107	Focus on the food supplies! The woman and children can be sold for money! Try to leave them unharmed!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0012
108	Hyaaaah!
109	Tsk. There's a lot of them. Honestly. What a hassle.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
110	Captain Ryle! They're attacking from the rear!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
111	We were tasked with protecting the merchants, not the supplies.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0042
112	I'll leave command to you. Try to save as many of the merchants as you can. Tell them to abandon their goods.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
113	But there's too many of them...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
114	What? Are you going to make me do everything? I brought you here precisely to deal with this kind of situation.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
115	I don't recall having recruited such useless soldiers for the Guild.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
116	Ye-yes, Sir! Understood!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0032
117	Men, we spread out and defend the rear and the front! If it comes down to it, don't hesitate to abandon the supplies!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
118	Protecting lives is our first priority! Do your duty!
119	I can't believe such a large group of bandits would attack us! Where is that kid?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
120	Waaahh!
121	It's okay...it's okay! Hurry, run!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
122	You're not going anywhere!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
123	Stop!	VO_elrike.elrike_battle_0019
124	Agh! You wench!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
125	Eeek?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0026
126	Yo-young lady?! Hurry and run! If they surround us, it'll all be over!
127	B-but, at this rate, everyone will...!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
128	Surround the prey and scatter them! If they are spread out thin, even the Guild Guard wouldn't be able to put up a fight!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
129	Ar-are we surrounded...?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0027
130	Hehe. Well, well. Looks like we've got some high quality prey mixed amongst the lot of them. Come now. Don't put up a fight.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
131	Getting to work before the sun has set, are we now? You're a rude bunch of villains.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
132	What...!?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
133	Resolve yourselves, you sorry excuses of mercenaries. This place is already under the jurisdiction of the Sand Hawks.	VO_balt.balt_battle_0010
134	Each grain of sand contains the honor and resolve of our comrades who have long fought in order to protect the freedom of those who live in this desert.
135	If you're going to tarnish this honor any further...then we'll have no choice but to end you all here!
136	It's the Sand Hawks! The bandit hunters are here...agh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
137	Hey, who are you calling bandit hunters? I'd prefer if you didn't spread such titles. We are vigilantes, plain and simple!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
138	Balt, you scum!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
139	Not only are you sorry excuses for mercenaries...but you've gone so far as to become bandits, trampling on the freedom of the desert.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
140	He-hey.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
141	Stand back, young lady. From here on, this is our battlefield.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
142	We have long fought and bled to maintain our reputation as mercenary vigilantes that protect this desert.
143	And now these idiots are attempting to destroy it all. We'll send them packing out of this desert!
