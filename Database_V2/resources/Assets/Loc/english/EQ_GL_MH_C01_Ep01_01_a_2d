001	Within the forest...
002	Well, that was a bit more tiring than usual.
003	Hmmm. According to my map, the trail should be right here.
004	Except it isn't. Oh well - at least I'm not going around in circles.
005	That's what you get, Sieg, when your references are all outdated.
006	I shouldn't be surprised.
007	It's not like people have been enthusiastic about exploring this region...
008	With the chaotic years that followed the end of the warring era.
009	Still, I should've brought better equipment. All this undergrowth is slowing me down...
010	Wait, what was that?
011	...
012	I thought I heard something. Must be my imagination.
013	Wait, there it is! A hunting trail!
014	I'm definitely onto something then!
015	The Village of the Divine... looks like it's more than just a myth...
016	An isolated village protected by a divine entity and untouched by the war?
017	Finally some signs of settlement in this forest.
018	(Rustling)
019	That doesn't sound good.
020	Grrrrrrr....
021	I don't suppose you'd roll over and be a good boy?
022	GRRRRR!!!!
023	Not your ordinary forest wolves, then.
