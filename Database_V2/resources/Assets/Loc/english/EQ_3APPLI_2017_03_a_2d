001	Although the Compass never faltered, the voyage towards the Twilight Zone was by no means an uneventful one.
002	One time we were tormented by the perfect calm...
003	What?! Th-there's no wind whatsoever...the ship won't move!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
004	Well...I can use my magic...
005	Time to display my powers as a witch! Forwaaaard!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
006	W-wow! It's moving forward! Lisbeth, do your best!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
007	That was about...10 centimeters...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
008	Laevateinn, let's at least give her points for effort...and enthusiasm.
009	One time it was a giant iceberg blocking our path.
010	At this rate, we'll hit it… Go around it!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0027
011	We don't have time to be making detours. That's just a piece of ice, right? We should just cut it.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0014
012	Huh?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0026
013	...You cut the iceberg in half!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
014	Amazing...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0020
015	Another time an underwater volcano erupted and we sailed in scorching water.
016	Oh, it's so hot...I can't take it anymore. I don't think I can wear clothes!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0030
017	True...huh, hey, you gotta endure! Don't take off your clothes, Amaterasu!
018	But in the Twilight Zone I never have to worry about that kind of stuff...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0031
019	In this way we made our way through the tumultuous ocean, continuing onward on our adventure.
020	In order to retrieve the Sun Keys stolen by the thief,
021	<p_name> and the others followed the Golden Compass and continue to sail the sea.
022	Meanwhile...the boat is covered by a thick fog that makes it impossible to see anything ahead.
023	Sigh... Not only can we not see anything but the waves are rough. If we get careless we could fall off the boat.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
024	if we follow the Compass, we shouldn't need to be able to see anything, but...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
025	Ugggh...sorry...I got...sea sick...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
026	Well, it's shaking pretty hard...but now might not be the best time?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0018
027	Uggrraaah!
028	...!!!
029	When I think about how we're going to have to go up against the Fallen, now isn't the time to be struggling with something like this.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0010
030	<p_name>! This way!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0020
031	O...okay!
032	Lacking any fighting skills, the girls protect <p_name>  as they fight.
033	Hey, Amaterasu. Could the Fallen be manipulating these monsters?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
034	I feel like they're different than the ordinary monsters I've encountered before.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
035	There's a high possibility of that. Taking advantage of the monsters' anxiety from the lack of sunlight...she must be manipulating their dark emotions.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
036	In order to eliminate the sunlight from all the worlds...
037	She may be using the monsters to directly harm...no, to kill, any who oppose her.
038	Sigh...Honestly, we've taken on quite the troublesome opponent. I'm getting sick of this.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0030
039	I'm getting a little...tired as well...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0030
040	Huh? What's happening to the two of you?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
041	With the sunlight diminishing...it might already be affecting their minds.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
042	After all, the energy that the sun gives to the world is enormous.
043	It's enough to say that, if it were to disappear, the world may very well be destroyed.
044	We have to make sure that doesn't happen!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
045	Heheh...I won't let you get in the way!
046	?!
047	...Ack!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
048	While momentarily distracted by the voice that pierces the fog, the enemy's attack grazes Lisbeth's cheek.
049	In order to identify the enemy who harmed her, Lisbeth turns and gazes into the fog towards the direction where the attack came from.
050	Huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
051	N-no...! Why?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
052	Appearing before Lisbeth is none other than...
053	Khhoooh...khhohhh...	VO_kaiser.kaiser_battle_0001
054	It is none other than the ultimate vermin, the King of Ants, Kaiser.
055	Huh, why are you here, Mr. Ant?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
056	No way...the one who stole the Sun Keys is...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
057	That's right...Liz...
058	Huh, oh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
059	Our curse will never be lifted...we must think of a new way of living.
060	I-I promise that I will find...a way to remove your curse!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
061	Why do only we as men have to suffer from this curse?
062	Why do we have to be oppressed by the humans that we love?
063	St-stop...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
064	Humans, insects, the flowers...we all equally suffer...from the disappearance of the sun...don't you think it would be fair?
065	Ack...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
066	If all is cursed...if all is trapped in darkness...don't you think that...gender inequalities would disappear as well?
067	...N-no.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
068	Liz...the insects you helped take flight and heal were ultimately killed by the witches...
069	No!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0022
070	Living as an insect...bares nothing but misfortune.
071	Whether we die prematurely as an insect...or are killed as maggots by humans...
072	B-but...there must be a way...to remove the curse!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
073	Liz...do you truly believe that Asmodeus' curse can be lifted?
074	Are you dreaming of insects returning to their human form?
075	Do you think it is something that will happen before my short lifespan runs out...or before I am killed?
076	...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
077	Liz...tell me...how is it going to be?
078	!!!
079	Eeek!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
080	...!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
081	Huff...huff...! Huh? Wh...where am I?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
082	Lisbeth wakes up to find herself surrounded by everyone looking at her with worried expressions on their faces.
083	Are you okay? You were moaning loudly...
084	A dream? Was that all...a dream?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
085	...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
086	Feeling the pain, Lisbeth looks down at her arm to see the vivid remains of the wound Kaiser had given her.
087	This wound...is it real? If so, was what happened...reality? Was I with...that ant?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
088	Maybe it was a trap set by the Fallen who is after the Sun Key that Lisbeth has...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
089	Huh...just now...did...I?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
090	What's the matter, Lisbeth? You seem to be deep in thought. Is there something on your mind?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0025
091	Oh, um...n-no...um...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
092	I was...dreaming, but...for some reason...I can't remember what it was about.
093	Can't you remember anything? It might lead to some clue that'll help us identify our enemy...	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
094	I'm sorry. It all just disappeared. I can't remember...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0036
095	Huh? We gained nothing from that? There's a high possibility this will be a reckless battle. Can we really continue on like this?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0030
096	I'm trying my best to remember! But...I can't!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
097	Hey, both of you, please stop!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
098	Uggrraaah!
099	!!!
