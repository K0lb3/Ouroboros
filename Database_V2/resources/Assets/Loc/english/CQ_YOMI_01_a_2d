001	Sob... My...brother...
002	Hey, are you okay?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0003
003	Who are you?!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
004	Me? I'm...no, I am Arkil, wanderer of the desert people.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
005	I went out of my way to rescue you when I found you collapsed on the desert sand. You better be thankful.
006	R-right... Thank you; you saved me. I am Yomi.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
007	I see. You came from the country of Wadatsumi, didn't you?
008	How do you know that?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0027
009	(Seriously. I'm pretty sure anyone can tell just from her outfit.)
010	It's because I work as a fortune teller. Let me see...you treasure that sword very much.
011	...!
012	And you come from a reasonably noble house.
013	?!
014	(Well, those are all things you can tell just from the look of her, but where is she from?)
015	Also...you have a brother. He is very important to you.
016	... ...
017	Huh? Did I get it wrong?
018	(I was sure she was murmuring something about that.)
019	I'll say that you're half right and half wrong.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
020	I see. So it's somewhat complicated then.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
021	You see everything.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0011
022	Of course. I told you that I'm a fortune teller.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
023	Lord Arkil! The enemy is attacking! Please, lend us your strength!
024	Oh well, fine then.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0030
025	Huh? So you're not a fortune teller?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
026	There's much you must do in order to survive in this country.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
027	In that case, I'll lend you my strength. I need to repay you for saving me.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0045
028	Thanks. Well, just don't push yourself too hard.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0033
