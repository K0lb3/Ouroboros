001	Let's retreat! Before that thing spreads!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
002	Wait! It's fine!	VO_rena.rena_sys_0043
003	It's not fine! We need to hurry up and get out of here!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
004	It's almost here!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0042
005	Yes...we just need to be swallowed by it.
006	But inside that...
007	Whoa! It's here!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0043
008	My power...!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0043
009	Ugh...ack... I'm being swallowed up by it!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
010	What the...?! What is this black thing! Aghhhh!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
011	It's seeping inside...ack, don't come! Ahhhhhh!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0028
012	Eeeeeeeek!!!
013	Hwahhh. Who...who...am I?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0026
014	Uck... H-huh? Is everyone okay?
015	Huh? What is this place? What happened to me?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
016	Who...am I?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
017	No! I can't remember anything!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0024
018	Hey, what happened to everyone?
019	What's going on? Where are we?!
020	We're inside the belly of the Rayvner.
021	Rena?!
022	Inside...the belly?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
023	What is a Rayvner?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0001
024	I remember now. The Rayvner's thoughts are what gives birth to that black mist.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
025	What do you mean by mist?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
026	Huh? I've seen you before but...aghh...I can't remember!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
027	Rena! What's going on? What happened to everyone?!
028	Their memories were eaten. But this was the only way to get close to the Rayvner.
029	Oh...that's right. Didn't we have to defeat something?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
030	Yes! Try to remember! Your enemies are here somewhere!
031	If we can defeat the Rayvner...the world will return to normal!
032	You'll be able to return to your own worlds! Your memory...will...huhh?!
033	Rena?! What's the matter?! Are you okay?
034	I'm...okay...	VO_rena.rena_sys_0018
035	Our own worlds? What are you talking about?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
036	Huh? Who are you anyway?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
037	Oh no... You're losing more and more memories!	VO_rena.rena_sys_0020
038	Hang in there! Try to remember!
039	Try to remember...what?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0022
040	More importantly, what is this place? There was something I needed to do...to do.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0002
041	What was it?
042	Mm... I also feel like there's somewhere I need to go home to, but...	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
043	Huh?
044	I wonder what I was called.
045	Oh! No! Don't disappear!	VO_rena.rena_battle_0022
046	Huh?! Did they disappear? What happened?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
047	Why is it just the two of us?
048	Since they're not from Babel...I think those two don't have too many memories of this world.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0029
049	Chloe, you have people here in Babel who still remember you...that's why don't disappear.
050	No!
051	Ohh! This is terrible! At this rate...this world will...	VO_rena.rena_sys_0028
052	Rena! Hang in there! Rena!
053	Please...defeat...the Rayvner.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0043
054	Something is coming!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
055	What is that?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
056	No way... Is that the Rayvner?!
057	I'm not sure, but that's the enemy, right?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
058	That's right! Chloe, try to remember!
059	My memory is hazy...and I can't remember clearly...but I understand they're the ones we must defeat!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
060	Huh?!
061	The enemy! Here they come!
