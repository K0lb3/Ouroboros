001	Ughh...uwahhh!!!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0019
002	Eeek!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0026
003	This is the true strength of Amaterasu...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0029
004	...She's strong.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0043
005	Heheh. After finishing all of you off, I'll use this girl to manipulate the sun and moon...plunging this entire world into darkness.
006	For starters, I already have four of the Sun Keys that I need to do that ...
007	Do you understand? This key is practically the same thing as your sun.
008	I know! That's why we won't let you hide the sun!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
009	Huh...key...? Y-you can't touch that!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
010	Tsk! Seems like her responsibility as the caretaker has made her regain her sanity a little? ...Still, it's too late!
011	I'm going to deal despair first and foremost to you people who have gotten in my way...
012	I'm going to do this by destroying the sun!
013	Kayako screams this and rapidly slams down and destroys the four Sun Keys in her hand.
014	Aaaaahhhh!!! How could you...?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0028
015	We can't afford for even one Sun Key to be destroyed! And you destroyed all four of them?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0020
016	I can't even be a scapegoat in this case...all the worlds will fall into darkness...
017	I-it's all my fault...if only I protected the Twilight Zone properly...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
018	Amaterasu, it's okay. We won't let the Sun Keys for our world be destroyed.
019	Huh? Didn't you just see? I destroyed the keys with my own hands just now!
020	I saw, but...the keys to our worlds are still here!
021	The four pull out their keys and show them to the shocked Kayako.
022	Impossible! There should only be one Sun Key to every world...
023	We don't plan to give away the secret. After all, we know you're a troublesome opponent to deal with.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
024	We...we are pirates that traveled multiple worlds, making the impossible possible! Accomplishing something like this is nothing!
025	Arghhh...?! No, I still won't admit defeat! I will make Amaterasu descend further into darkness...
026	Amaterasu! Look! The Sun Keys are safe! Open your eyes!
027	If protecting the sun is your job...then protect them properly!
028	You learned the importance of that from that pirate, didn't you?
029	That's right...he told me...without the sun, there would be nothing to enjoy!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
030	...Ooohhhhh?!
031	Impossible! Did Amaterasu just repel Uzushiomaru from her body?!
032	Now, everyone! Let's defeat Kayoko and settle this once and for all! If we can do that then...
033	Yes! We can stop Amaterasu from having to make the same sacrifice!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
034	Sacrifice...?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
035	In the timeline that we came from, the keys were destroyed and, because the sun vanished, you sacrificed yourself...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
036	But you don't have to follow in those same footsteps anymore.
037	Amaterasu, please, fight together with us.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
038	Amaterasu! As friends, let's protect the sun together and fight side by side...please!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
039	...Understood.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
040	If these are the friends that the captain said I would encounter...then I choose to believe.
041	You little...brats! I won't allow you to destroy my scheme!!!
042	Very well. I'll use this Sun Key's power to...
043	We won't let you! We have the same key here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
044	I can't control its power! Then I will beat you all by force and gain complete authority over you!
045	Uzushiomaru, wield all your power and take them all down!
