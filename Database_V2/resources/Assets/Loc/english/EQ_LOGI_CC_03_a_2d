001	Agh. You have so much power! But...why are we doing this now?	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
002	Logi...what happened to Dias and Agatha?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
003	...! I...I don't know...what happened to Dias, but...Agatha...Agatha...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
004	No... Did she...die?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0020
005	I'm not sure, but...she suddenly disappeared.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0039
006	Disappeared? What do you mean? Well, I guess you wouldn't know.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0025
007	But at least there's hope.
008	Hope?
009	If you haven't seen her die and you don't know where she is, then that means she's alive somewhere, right?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
010	...! Ohh!
011	That's right...I was blown away. Blown away? Did that happen to Agatha too?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
012	I'm sure that Agatha is alive. You couldn't protect her, right? Just make sure that you do next time.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
013	But, in your current state, you wouldn't be able to, Logi. You've forgotten the basics of being a knight.
014	The basics of being a knight...?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
015	It's to not close your eyes. I taught you that, didn't I?
016	You closed your eyes each time I hit you.
017	I-I won't close them anymore!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
018	Even if your eyes are open, the eyes of your heart are closed.
019	Logi...did you see the enemy? Who was it that brought about the downfall of Envylia?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
020	The Holy Guard. I was somewhat aware of this. But...I couldn't believe that the Holy Order of Babel...those responsible for upholding justice within the continent...would do something like that.	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
021	We just wanted peace with Wratharis...ack!
022	So you were fighting for peace, Logi...but, deep down in your heart, you didn't want to wield your sword.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0045
023	You believe that obtaining from wielding your sword will bring about peace.
024	I-isn't that the case? I wanted a world where we didn't have to fight...where we could understand each other!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
025	But your adversaries ruthlessly directed their blades towards you. Still, you didn't want to use your sword. Right?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
026	If you were to cut someone down or if someone had to be cut down, you prefer that it were you. Right?
027	...!
028	I, too, have thought that way in the past. Still, that doesn't stop them from coming and taking everything you hold dear. After all...justice belongs to those who are victorious.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0017
029	Does justice belong to those who are...victorious?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
030	Right now, do you know people are calling your father?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
031	The great sinner. That's the lie that the Holy Guard has been spreading.
032	No...no! What did father ever do to be called that?! Why is the Holy Guard doing this?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
033	History is written by the victors...and victory is only obtained by taking something from others.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0016
034	Logi...you don't want to take anything, you don't want to lose anything, and you don't want others to lose anything. You've been that way ever since you were small.
035	Do you think that way of thinking is the source of my weakness?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
036	No. Your way of thinking isn't wrong. But, in order to achieve this, you have no choice but to become strong.
037	To not take, to not lose, and to not have others lose...
038	Which is justice...? You need the power to choose your own justice.
039	The power to choose...?
040	Yes. You need to remember that Logi. So...come. I'll teach you.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
041	A skillful swordsman will see everything from the tip of his blade. The breathing, movement, and even the intentions of his opponent. Logi...it's about time you open your eyes.
042	Setsuna...
