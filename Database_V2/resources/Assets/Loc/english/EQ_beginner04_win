001	All right, we managed to get a Holy Knight Token. Thanks for helping!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0033
002	Tokens required are different for each Job. Collect them from the Weekly Quests, Arena, and Multi Shop.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0003
003	Holy Knights have higher HP and PDEF than Soldiers. It allows them to fight on the front line.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0006
004	Abilities learned as a Solider don't disappear, so you can set them on a Holy Knight and fight with it.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0009
005	Jobs prepared vary depending on the unit. You can customize them according to your own setup.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0045
006	Well then, from under Holy Knight on the Unit Details screen, can you set the Holy Knight Token and change my Job?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0041
