001	Sigh...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
002	I can't believe I messed up like that. I ended up being a burden to another squadron...to Captain Vettel.
003	Seriously... I'm such an idiot!
004	Sigh... I'll go back to my room and reflect on my actions.
005	Chloe!
006	Captain Vettel?! I-I'm sorry about today!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
007	Are you feeling bad about what happened?
008	Ye-yes...
009	Chloe...did anyone from the Crown's Guard lose their life today?
010	What?! N-no...but some suffered minor casualties...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
011	Then, that's fine.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
012	As someone who leads a squadron, your aim is to return safely with all your knights alive.
013	You accomplished that, Chloe. So you can stop worrying.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0006
014	But if I'd assessed the situation earlier, no one would've even gotten hurt.
015	... ...
016	... ...
017	Chloe, let's do it like the old days! Give me 50 swings!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
018	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
019	Come on. Give me 50 swings!
020	Oh, um...yes, sir!
021	One! Two!
022	Why does Captain Vettel want me to practice my swings? Is it because I'm weak?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
023	...On your mark!
024	Yes, sir!
025	But somehow I feel calm like I used to when I would swing my sword.
026	All right. Stop!
027	Yes, sir!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
028	How about it? Do you feel refreshed?
029	Wow... Yes! Thank you!
030	U-um... Swinging my blade like I used to helped me to calm down.
031	I feel so embarrassed that I lost myself like that. I'm sorry!
032	Chloe, raise your head. I just told you that there's no need to apologize, didn't I?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
033	But...
034	Oh, that's right.
035	Raise your head. This is a present for you.
036	What...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
037	Captain Vettel, it's time for your meeting.
038	Ah. Well, I have to go!
039	Oh, I'm sorry! Thank you for taking your time 
040	I'm happy that you became commander of the Crown's Guard, Chloe.
041	What...?!
042	Consider this my present to your appointment as commander.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
043	!!!
044	Oh, um...well...thank you!
045	Oh...it is a gift? I wonder what...it is...
046	Wow!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
047	It's beautiful!
048	...Sniff.
049	Seriously, Captain Vettel is...awesome!
050	This is the antique glass that I received from Captain Vettel. It's very important to me!	VO_chloe.chloe_chara_0007
