001	This is the last one.
002	Ah, so you survived.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0003
003	It seems like it.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0004
004	Still, these enemy troops may have gathered because you hadn't finished off the first one.
005	I understand. I'm truly sorry. There was no time to hesitate when taking a life.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
006	You're truly a kind soul.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0030
007	There is one thing I'd like to ask you.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
008	...?
009	If...if you were betrayed by the one you cared about, what would you do?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
010	If you were robbed of the thing most important to you for a reason unknown to you...?
011	Could you...kill the person responsible?
012	Well, first I'd determine the reason for their actions...or so I'd like to say, but actually I think that would be meaningless.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
013	Why?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
014	If a person was determined to steal something that important to you, they'd have to have had a certain amount of resolve.
015	Resolve must be met with resolve. That's what I think.
016	Resolve with resolve...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
017	Or something like that. Anyway, I hate that sort of thing, that's why I'm just hanging out here.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
018	I say who cares about dealing with the hassle of things like family, honor, and revenge.
019	That being said, living freely also requires its own form of resolve.
020	You're right. It seems that I lacked resolved on various different levels.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
021	Thank you for your advice. I'm glad that I met you.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0034
022	Actually, I am looking for my brother. He killed my parents and fled our home.
023	I see what you mean by complicated.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0031
024	That's why I want to borrow your knowledge and your resources, Arkil. You're not really a fortune teller, are you?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
025	Of course, I'm not asking you to do this for free. If you lend me a hand, I'll do whatever I can to repay you.
026	I've resolved myself to that.
027	Heh. That's quite an expression you're wearing now.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0010
028	Very well then. Sounds like an interesting way to quell my boredom for now.
029	Thank you.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0041
030	(Brother...I promise to track you down!)
