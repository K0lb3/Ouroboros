001	Owww... Ahhhh! I'm bleeeeding!	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0019
002	Eeeeeeeek! So-sooooo scary! Don't look at me!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0025
003	Wh-who are you?!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
004	Oh? Hello, folks. Nice costumes. I'm Alexis.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0024
005	Uhh, you're not a ghost? Your face is incredibly frightening.	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
006	You know... With all the costumes and fights going on, Halloween is pretty darn amazing.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
007	Y-you're pretty scary. What are you even trying to say?	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0022
008	My sincere apologies. When it comes to Halloween, I'm what they call something of a newbie.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0035
009	Eeeeek!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0028
010	Don't laugh with that face! It's honestly frightening!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0028
011	More importantly... What were you doing to the children of the town with those injections?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
012	Children? Oh, are you referring to the children who I found collapsed and sleeping in the middle of the woods?	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
013	Well, as you can see, I'm a doctor, so—
014	What?!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
015	I thought it was strange that they were passed out in the outskirts of the village.
016	Having diagnosed them, they appear to have ingested a weak poison.
017	Elizabeth...you...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
018	No way! It shouldn't be harmful! At least when it comes to adults...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0025
019	Oh... Did you make those sweets?	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0044
020	Indeed, the substances pose no risk of harm for an adult.
021	E-exactly! I only used things that weren't harmful to the body.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
022	However...when consumed by a child, it becomes a highly stimulating substance.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0012
023	A highly stimulating substance, huh?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
024	It worked too effectively on the children and created a poisoning effect, so to speak. Well, it's nothing severe.
025	That explains everything. I guess it was a little too early for children to dabble with that kinda stuff.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0044
026	... ...
027	(Please, don't get Mia anymore worked up.)	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0029
028	Thus...I was injecting children with a relief agent while making my way to town.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0006
029	I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'm glad things didn't get out of hand. Thank you.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0035
030	You're a good person, Mr. Grim Reaper.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0044
031	...Still, that costume is a way too terrifying.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0022
032	Aww, really? Is it? Heheh. I heard that Halloween was this kind of event, so I sort of went all out.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0025
033	I'm not complimenting you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0011
034	Mmm... Anyway, we've managed to complete our mission safely, right?	VO_mea.mea_battle_0023
035	Yeah, we've finished distributing the sweets long ago, and we've solved the problems we encountered. I guess all's well that ends well. I'm going home to sleep.
036	All's well that ends well? I haven't attended yet, so I'll be going there now.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
037	In fact, I'm very much looking forward to participating... Tee hee hee...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0007
038	U-um... Ma-maybe it'll be better if you removed some of your makeup!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
039	What? Why?	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0004
040	Eeeek! You're too close! Don't look at me!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0048
041	Jeez...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
042	After the candy has been handed out and the case of the collapsing children solved...
043	The town's Halloween spirit reaches its peak.
044	Meanwhile, in some areas, reported incidences of spontaneous screaming continue to persist.
045	Most were said to have been caused by Alexis's smile.
046	<br>Happy ★ Halloween!
