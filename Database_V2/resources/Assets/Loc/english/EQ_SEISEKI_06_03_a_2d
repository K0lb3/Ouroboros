001	Oh no, my body feels so heavy! I can't keep up with the monsters' speed!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
002	Hey, what's the meaning of this? Didn't we avoid the gassy areas?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
003	W-well... oh no... I didn't know that this area had gotten...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0047
004	You fool! Do you even know your way around this mountain?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0012
005	Geez, don't get me started now! You didn't listen to a word I said!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
006	Weren't you saying you were suffering from dehydration?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
007	Be quiet already! Instead of sweating the details, as the Lord Commander, why don't you come up with a solution here?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
008	That's easier said than done!<br>Whah!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
009	Tsk!<br>What would Lord Vettel do in this situation?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
010	And what on earth would Lord Zain or the other captains have done here?!
011	Uhrrr!<br>Whhooaaaa!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
012	Captain Monzein!
013	You fool!<br>Don't rely now on some people who aren't here!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
014	But...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
015	Don't think you can solve anything by copying someone else!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
016	Grasp the future with your own two hands! If you can't do that, you should quit being a knight altogether!
017	...<br>With my own two hands...
018	Kanon! Behind you!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
019	Huh? Whah?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
020	?!<br>M-Spica?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
021	Let's go. We can leave this to them.
022	Huh?
023	You should prioritize the restoration of Excalibur now. Come on...
024	Huh?! Are you planning on just leaving Chloe and Captain Monzein behind like that?! I could never...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
025	Huh?!<br>What's this wind?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
026	...?!
027	What is this?<br>It's sweeping down all of the monsters!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
028	“We left,” you said?<br>I've really been looked down on.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
029	Geez... why do I got to leave the Holy Guard, huh? That's just too unreasonable!
030	Seida!<br>But why?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
031	Why, you ask?
032	Didn't you say we need to restore Excalibur to release Kagura from Othima's Philosopher's Stone?	VO_caida.caida_chara_0005
033	Seida...
034	Come on, let's hurry up and take care of the rest. We don't want to be wasting time here.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0015
035	Hm! As such a latecomer, don't say that as if it's so easy! We got affected by volcanic gas... 	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
036	I thought I just blew all of that gas away with that gust, didn't I?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
037	...!<br>It's true, the feeling in my body seems to be returning!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
038	Any other problems?
039	None!<br>All right! Let's go!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
040	Ugh...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
041	Pant...pant...<br>Did we clean them all up for now?
042	Yes!<br>Thank you, Seida!<br>This was all thanks to you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
043	Phuh! You don't need to thank her! Why were you late in the first place?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
044	It's not like I was loafing around somewhere, you know.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
045	I was looking into Lord Zain's notes once more, because I wanted to look something up about Excalibur.
046	Something about Excalibur?
047	It seemed too unreasonable to look for a hidden blacksmith's forge on such a vast mountain.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
048	I wanted to find some sort of clue! But actually, it made me aware of another concerning factor!
049	Another concerning factor?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
050	Well, all hope isn't necessarily lost, but it's possible that we may not be able to restore Excalibur anymore.
051	Huh?!
052	W-wait a second...<br>What are you talking about?<br>Can't you say something, Spica?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
053	Right. Before that, I need to have a word with you. What exactly is your objective here?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
054	Huh?
055	I had the chance to observe the situation.
056	Leading you into an area with gas, and moreover, an area with a lot of monsters!
057	Why did you act in such a roundabout way? If you're after Excalibur, it would have been more reasonable to just take it from them.
058	What are you talking about?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
059	Hey, what are you talking about, Seida? Spica merely led us in a way to avoid the areas with eruption danger!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
060	Well, let me tell you first that the eruption risk of this mountain is just a tale for the people.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
061	Huh?
062	Lord Zain called this an active volcano and marked it as forbidden territory, only to hide Yogi Ku's forge from the eyes of the world.
063	The chances of Ramproad mountain ever erupting is very low, and there's no way that the mountain's own guide wouldn't know about that, is there?
064	...
065	That axe looks like it's seen a lot of action. You must be powerful...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
066	There should have been an opportune timing to snatch Excalibur away from Kanon, wasn't there?
067	Well... it's like you say.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
068	Like I thought! You're not actually serving Yogi Ku, are you?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
069	But yes, why have you been going about it in such a roundabout way?
070	Couldn't you have just come to snatch Excalibur away after we'd gone to restore it?
071	I couldn't decide whether to steal Excalibur or not... without getting to know you.
072	I just wanted to talk to you... to find out what kind of people you all are.
073	Huh?
074	“You all?”<br>Which means, me too?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
075	Yes...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
076	I was really wondering... what kind of people killed Lord Zahar.
077	Huh?!<br>Zahar?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
078	Zahar... Is she talking about the one who was sealed into the Door of Truth truth along with Captain Cadanova?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
079	So... are you from Wratharis?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
080	I do seem to be at a disadvantage here.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
081	Phuh! She ran away?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
082	Since she works for Zahar, we can't just let her get away.<br>Seida...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
083	Right.<br>Kanon, you guys should head for the limestone cave.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
084	According to the notes Lord Zain left behind, Yogi Ku ought to be there.
085	I don't believe he'll be working for us though...
086	Huh?!
087	We'll meet up again later.<br>Please just hurry for now!
088	Wait, Seida!<br>Please don't hurt Spica if it can be avoided!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
089	Huh?!<br>Why wouldn't she?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
090	I think... she's not a bad person. I think you'll understand if you talk to her. Please, Captain Monzein!
091	Geez, what a troublesome Lord Commander.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
092	Tsk!<br>I can't make any promises!
093	Wait a second!<br>Don't you know she's on the side of that infamous Zahar?!
094	But... we don't have anything to attain by getting rid of her, do we?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
095	Anyway, we need to head for the forge.<br>Let's go, to the limestone cave!
