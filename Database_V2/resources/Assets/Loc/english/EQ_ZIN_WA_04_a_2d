001	We will not let outsiders in! That's the law of our village.
002	The law...?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
003	The law?! Who cares about that?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
004	If you don't hurry up, your village will perish! It's a curable disease! Hurry, take me to the sick!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
005	I cannot! Even if the village were to perish, we must protect our law.
006	Ack... There's no talking sense into him. Sen!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
007	Y-yes!
008	How many people are suffering from the disease?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
009	About...14 or 15.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0018
010	I see. Arkil, give me back the medicine that I gave you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
011	Sure. Is it enough?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
012	For now. However, the disease may return if it's only taken once.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
013	We must hurry and gather the ingredients. We'll use what ingredients we have—as for the rest...	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
014	Sen, do the flowers called Snowbells grow here?
015	Snowbells grow on that mountain over there…	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0004
016	Got it! Well then, first of all, we must quickly get this medicine to the sick.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0038
017	O-okay!
018	Are you gonna get it? The...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0003
019	Snowbells. They grow on exceptionally high mountains. Of course, I'll go.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
020	It's pointless.
021	It's not pointless. I'll tell you once again. This sickness is curable.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
022	Hmph... The mountain is dangerous... There is a monster... He rules the mountain...
023	You won't return.
024	I'm well aware that it's dangerous. But I can't abandon these lives that can be saved!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
025	He-hey! Hold up!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0048
026	Arkil, why do you follow me?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
027	What do you mean "why"? Wouldn't it be better if both of us searched for it rather than you going on your own?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0031
028	Besides...
029	Kshhhaaaaa!!!	VO_Mmandragora.Mmandragora_battle_0028_c
030	You know if you were to die, we wouldn't be able to save the village.
031	You're right. Still...I can't afford to die here!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
