001	Captain Kudan used to often say...
002	He wanted power. He wanted the absolute power that can surpass any in the world.
003	Is that somehow related to what happened this time?
004	Why do you think that? Regarding the strategy this time, you should haven't been given any details yet.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
005	To be honest, I think it's instinct. The fact that Kagura and Lord Zain are leading and that most of the captains have gathered.
006	Seeing the situation, it's because a plan bigger than anything we've done until now is about to happen, right?
007	I've been wondering all this time why just Captain Kudan isn't here.
008	You didn't want me to talk about that
009	I was thinking maybe he was removed on purpose.
010	Indeed. Your instinct really isn't one to be reckoned with.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
011	I'm worried about Captain Kudan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
012	Ever since that one time at Saga, he seems to always be contemplating something.
013	Have you witnessed Kudan's power of darkness?
014	In the past...when I went to rescue the now deceased Chihaya, she said to me:
015	Use my light to neutralize the darkness.
016	Does that mean that Captain Kudan is carrying darkness within him?!
017	Yes. Most likely. Most likely since he was born.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
018	 I don't know if it's because of that, but since he joined the Holy Guard, his talent has been increasing exponentially.
019	I heard that him officially joining the Holy Guard at age 15 made him the youngest in its history.
020	Because of the considerable fanfare he received regarding his talent when he joined, it seems like Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova had their eyes on him.
021	Then...after being the target of everyone's expectations, in order to obtain more knowledge and experience and to strengthen his abilities, he decided to study abroad.
022	Study abroad? Are you talking about that fateful day...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
023	Yes, that fateful time. One of the countries he visited during his studies, he ended up watching fall before his very eyes.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
024	Greed Dike's attack on Wadatsumi!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
025	Yes. He stood in front of the unexperienced Wadatsumi fighters and fought as effectively as he could.
026	But...the only one to survive was Captain Kudan along with Kagura.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
027	Yes. Try to imagine.
028	A 15-year-old fresh knight, he sees all his allies massacred in front of his eyes as he stands there. It truly must have been hell.
029	In Kudan's head, that image is being played over and over again.
030	The dangerous signs in his behavior began around that time as well.
031	So are you saying that the tragedy he witnessed awoke the darkness within Captain Kudan?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
032	Most likely.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
033	Thanks to that trauma, what was already lying dormant with him rushed forward to the front, causing the power of darkness to awaken with him. That's the most likely explanation.
034	Apparently, Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova long troubled over how to help Kudan recover.
035	In the end...Captain Cadanova accepted him into the 4th Regiment and showed him the road to light.
036	That man tried to dispel the source of darkness from within him.
037	However, for some reason, there were many incidences regarding forces of darkness occurring around him...
038	His studies and the effect that the power of darkness had on him increased steadily...until finally that incident that you were here to witness.
039	Where Captain Cadanova died.
040	That man tried to rescue Kudan with only his own strength. Perhaps he sensed something similar to him.
041	In comparison to Lord Zain, Captain Cadanova's light was not all that bright, and he would sometimes wield the power of darkness.
042	Captain Cadanova...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
043	In contrast to the two of them was Lord Zain...he was steadfast in his justice.
044	I see. That's why Chihaya told me about Captain Kudan...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0045
045	Probably. However, ironically, Chihaya, who gave Kudan advice, was ultimately assassinated. Causing a further negative effect on Kudan.
046	His inability for not having been able to stop her assassination fed his desire for more power. Ultimately, unleashing what was inside him.
047	He himself seems to be trying his best to suppress it, but...
048	It's too dangerous to let Kudan in his current state touch the darkness.
049	There's a possibility that it will cause Captain Kudan to lose balance within himself.
050	Yes. The reason why Lord Zain removed Kudan from this task was all for his own sake.
051	Worded different, you mean that a darkness that big exists within Wadatsumi right now, right?
052	Yes...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
053	I'm sorry to bother you while you're engaged, but we're almost out of the forest. After that, once we cut through the plains, we'll be at the rendezvous point.
054	Oh, the monsters are here to welcome us. Everyone, get into fighting positions. Hurry!
