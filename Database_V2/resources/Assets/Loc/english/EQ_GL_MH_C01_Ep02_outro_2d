001	The Divine Protector is no more, Chief. Siegfried and I buried it.
002	You have done well, Soren. What happened was beyond your control. Perhaps we are no longer worthy of divine protection…
003	Were we not devout enough? We perform the ritual every year…
004	(This probably isn't the best time to tell them about Alchemy…)
005	…But it may also be a positive sign. That it is time for us to take matters into our own hands.
006	We've relied on our Divine Protector for too long… when the raiders attacked, we were at a complete loss.
007	It's only thanks to Siegfried here that we were able to successfully drive them out.
008	Nothing to it. It's my way of repaying you and the village's kindness.
009	All that said… without the Divine Protector, I am no longer a Speaker. I'm not sure what I can do for the village now.
010	Then it's time for you to leave and see the world. You've been here far too long, Soren.
011	…!
012	Haha. You mentioned you were a traveller, Siegfried. Would you do us one last favor and take Soren with you?
013	There's no doubt he has special talents. I'd like for him to look beyond this little village.
014	Uh… I don't know if I can take care of a kid.
015	He's shy, but he'll learn. Especially from a man like you! Haha!
016	Haha… ha… (What did I get myself into?)
017	Siegfried… can I come along, then?
018	(I want to find out more about this power I have. What Siegfried called 'Alchemy'.)
019	(Maybe then… I'll find out more about myself and why I'm here.)
020	Well… I do want to track down the perpetrator. The raiders were reporting to someone. Leaving you alone here might not be a good idea.
021	Guess I don't have a choice, huh?
