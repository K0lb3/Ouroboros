001	Ack! I didn't sign up for this! It was supposed to be a simple escort job!
002	Get out of this forest!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0012
003	A-ack!
004	The rest of them have fled. Well, we've chased them out quite extravagantly.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0010
005	I can't believe they'd trespass into our forest so boldly.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
006	Gluttony... They seem to have forgotten about the dark abyss lying asleep in the forest of Saga. 	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0013
007	Aghhh?!
008	The true protector has finally made an appearance.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0011
009	Shaman! You're safe...
010	I'm sorry. There were more rats than I'd expected. It delayed me from getting here.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0033
011	And the treatment for the tree?
012	We picked the Spirit Grass. If we turn this into powder and mix it with the earth...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1008
013	Understood. I see. So this grass is effective. I'll remember that.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0044
014	Are you two all right?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0002
015	Yes.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0006
016	That being said, what are we going to do from here? They're not the type who would give up after one failure.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0002
017	That's where things get difficult. This is the edge of the forest, where the voice of the spirits doesn't reach.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
018	In order to ward off people like them, we might just really have to station guardians.
019	If that's the case, I have one idea.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0002
020	We've learned that they've been breaking the Magna Code with their experiments here.
021	This is an act that goes against the suzerain law, correct?
022	True.	VO_rusia.rusia_event_1005
023	Still, Saga is far from Northern Pride. It may be difficult for the Holy Guard to directly intervene.
024	That's why we can leak this information to Gluttony and Slothstein!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0010
025	If those two countries, across the sea, were to exercise their authority, then I'm sure it would paralyze even the Trade Company from acting carelessly.
026	From the perspective of the two countries, they can take the attitude that they haven't been involved in the experiments, and Northern Pride will own them a favor.
027	That's not a bad idea, right?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
028	Fortunately, I'm well connected enough in Gluttony to make negotiations possible!
029	But what about Slothstein?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0031
030	Although they were probably imported, they did have Guard Droids.
031	To avoid any suspicion of being involved, there's a possibility that they won't touch on this problem altogether.
032	Well...hmm...I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm really not sure how Slothstein will act on this.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
033	Your idea relies on the basis of creating a standoff from both countries. It won't quite work with just Gluttony.
034	I agree...	VO_alba.alba_sys_0022
035	I may have a lead in Slothstein.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1010
036	Really?!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
037	Yes. A wizard called Vincent. He lives in a very large mansion.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_1047
038	Vincent?! The 'wizard of the machine country'? That Vincent?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0026
039	Yes. But he hates being called that.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0007
040	What? You are friends with the authority on magic theory?! You've got surprising connections.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0031
041	A little too surprising! It's the biggest surprise of the day!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0046
042	I was going to send him a letter regarding another matter. I should able to contact him right away.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1013
043	Well then, it's decided! We're going to get busy from here!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0008
044	Will this enable us to protect the forest?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1008
045	Of course! On my stubbornness as a merchant!	VO_alba.alba_chara_1004
046	... ...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0022
047	Hey, what's with the long face. The forest is safe now, right?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0003
048	I was thinking about the fight just now.
049	I think that fight was a necessary one.
050	Sometimes people need to fight. It may be against beasts or against nature.
051	Or against others with ideas that differ from our own.
052	That's why a business like mine works.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0010
053	I think you'd be able to make a name for yourself as a mercenary.
054	I'm a tree doctor. I'm fine with just that.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0016
055	I see. What I said was stupid. Forget about it.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0004
056	I hate fighting.
057	...I know.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
058	But...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1008
059	Because I hate fighting, I realized that I must think about it.
060	I want to know how to minimize casualties...and to end the conflict as swiftly as possible.
061	I realized that that's what I should be thinking about.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1013
062	I see. My work here is done. I'll move on to the next battlefield.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0023
063	Knowing you, I doubt we'll meet in battle again.
064	If we ever meet again, tell me about your battle as a tree doctor.
065	I will. I promise.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0007
066	If Aruba and Lucian weren’t here...I wouldn't have been able to protect this forest myself.
067	There is more I must learn.
068	I will protect this world...this beautiful forest, with my own hands.
069	So...let's go. Like the wind that travels this earth, we head on our next journey.
