001	Huh! What's with this butterfly?!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0016
002	Why doesn't this insect listen to orders?! Do our incantations not work on them?!
003	Incantations?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
004	It's an easy, artificial technique that men with no background in magic use. You learned about it, didn't you?
005	I forgot!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
006	Me too!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0008
007	Don't be so proud about it!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
008	Tsk! It's true that we can't use magic. That's why women have been doing whatever they want to us.	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0010
009	But, with this latest incantation gear Jackal Over
010	and the wrath of the insects, the witches stand no chance against us!
011	The wrath...of the insects?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
012	These insects were originally men that were oppressed by women.	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0011
013	All we've done is use our incantations to stoke their rage a little!
014	Are you...forcing them to fight?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
015	It's for the sake of revolution–for the sake of justice!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0008
016	So that's why the Vermin started attacking people!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
017	How terrible! That's so wrong!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
