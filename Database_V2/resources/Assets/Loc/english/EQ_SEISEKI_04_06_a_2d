001	Day of Strategy Implementation<br>Wadatsumi - Unspecified Port
002	We arrived. It's the Wadatsumi port.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
003	You're right. Finally.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
004	Kanon and the other's support troops are scheduled to land from separate locations.
005	A rendezvous point has been set up, so first let's head there.
006	Um, I have a question... Why didn't we leave together?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
007	First, it was to prevent our movements from being picked up by Orion from Greed Dike, who is eyeing the Mikaboshi.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
008	Also, to avoid the eyes of a portion of the Holy Order who has an eerie attachment to Sacred Stones.
009	The Holy Order...is completely a part of us.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
010	This may be unwarranted, but...just in case. They're in a much better situation to get information than Greed Dike.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
011	In fact, right before departure, they congratulated me. Depending on the way you look at it, they could be scrounging for information.
012	Anyway, it's best to get close to them before they find out about Mikaboshi.
013	That's why we made them move separately from us.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0046
014	Yes.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
015	In order to make it look we're going to multiple locations, we had the gathered Paladins separate into a few groups and head in different directions.
016	They're all going their individual routes but will meet up in the same spot. From there, the plan begins.
017	I see...So you're being extra careful.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0044
018	It can't be helped.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
019	It's always best to avoid things that may turn into problems down the road.
020	Understood. Then all that's left is for us to head to that rendezvous point!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0045
021	Even as we speak, look what's decided to show up!
022	This area used to be inhabited. Wild monsters, huh? Let's quickly take them out!
