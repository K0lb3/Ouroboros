001	Is this...an Alkaroid? Plus, its mechanism is based on the Beckrams!
002	What's going on? Why are the Beckrams attacking me?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0016
003	Instead of rattling on, how about you chase them?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
004	You're gonna lose your valuable item to those dogs.
005	Huh?! Argh! Come back!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
006	Huff...huff...! There's no way I can catch up!
007	If you have time to talk, then move your legs. Only a desperate struggle yields the sweet nectar of victory!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
008	Th-that's impossible! There's no way a human can catch up with an Alkaroid running at full speed.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0012
009	Sigh. Honestly. Why did he leave a job to someone so inadequate?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
010	Wh-what...?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0013
011	Whatever it is the dogs took from you...I guess it's not that important to you, huh? 	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
012	I'll take care of the rest. You run back home and go to bed.
013	Ack! A mafia-like you wouldn't understand!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0042
014	That Alkaroid has the latest state-of-the-art abilities...
015	I'm talking about your attitude.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0003
016	It doesn't matter if you're a mafia or a repairman.
017	You can't entrust anything to someone who isn't willing to risk their own lives for their job.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
018	...!
019	That bell is a symbol of Slothstein.
020	I like the sound of that bell. After all, it's the sound of happiness!
021	Listen up, repairman. For a man, work is not just a means to eat.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
022	I know that.
023	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
024	There's no way I'm surrendering it to those blasted dogs! Agh! I'm gonna catch up with them!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0029
025	Hmph. Look at you, suddenly showing some spine. Next time, try doing that from the start. Let's go, men!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
026	Leave it to us, Don! We've evacuated all residents from each street!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0007
027	The dogs are headed down Rozalt Street towards the main road! We can take them on whenever you're ready!	VO_mafia-b.mafia-b_sys_0005
028	Wh-what the...?!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0025
029	There are different ways to fight depending on your opponent. There's no point in fighting blindly.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
030	Don Taras!
031	We'll take care of the dogs. After all, this is the job that I've staked my life on.
032	Repairman, you better get back the item you repaired as if your life depended on it!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0023
033	Got it!
034	All right, men, let's put on a show! Once we get back to the mansion, we've got the highest quality champagne waiting for us. Let's hurry up and get this over with! 
035	Huff...huff... I finally caught up!	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0029
036	Well then, I'll have you return the key to the sound of happiness in this city!
037	I'm surprised that Don Taras intervened.
038	It was a miscalculation. If that man is starting to get involved, then it can make things complicated.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
039	Shall we retreat?	VO_keibi.keibi_sys_0016
040	Yes. In any case, we've reaped our rewards. The fact that Edward took out the Philosopher's Stone is an indisputable fact.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
041	Find the location of the Philosopher's Stone that he's acquired.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0003
042	Understood!
043	The mafia who control the underground world, huh?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0016
044	If we bring them in, it'll give us a decent amount of strength. Let's go!	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
045	Okay. All that's left is to set this.
046	Father, look! A wedding!
047	Congratulations on your wedding!
048	You better be happy, okay?!
049	Ohh! The bell is ringing! Veloz must have made it!
050	Yes. He returned the sound of the bell to the city.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0020
051	The sound of happiness, huh?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0044
052	Thank you, Veloz. You've allowed for a worthy congratulations to a new beginning.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0033
053	I'll take back my words from earlier.
054	Huh?! What is this thing?
055	When I said that bell should be removed.
056	The sound of that bell isn't only congratulating those two on their wedding...but it brings happiness to the people of this city.
057	Hahah. Don't worry about it. After all, you're the one who fixed it.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0011
058	...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0016
059	...Veloz?
060	Perhaps I wanted the sound of this bell to myself.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0005
061	Huh?!
062	I wanted to ring it...just for her.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
063	Veloz...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0029
064	But that isn't the sound that she would've wanted.
065	The sound she liked was the one that celebrated and imparted happiness to everyone.
066	Oh, Veloz!
067	Fiona, how was it compared to the bells from last time?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0001
068	Yes, it was the same sound! Just like last time, it was a very loud sound! You fixed it, didn't you, Veloz?
069	Thank you!
070	No, I'm the one who should be thanking you.
071	...?
072	This bell taught me how to face myself.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0011
073	I just did my job the best that I could.
074	Wow! It really is an amazing sound! I'm sure this...will reach her!
075	What?
076	You told me, didn't you, Veloz? About the person who went far away.
077	This bell is big, so I'm sure it is reaching that person! That's what I think!
078	You think she can hear it, huh?
079	... ...
080	Yeah, I'm sure you're right.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0007
081	One day, I want to hear the sound of this bell on my wedding.
082	In that case, Fiona, until you get married, I promise to fix it every time it breaks–no matter how many times that might be.
083	Really? You promise?!
084	Of course.	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0004
085	It looks like the time that had stopped is moving once again.
086	Now I can no longer afford to die until the young lady celebrates her wedding day.
087	Hehe...	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0007
088	Can you hear the sound of the bell?	VO_veloz.veloz_sys_0002
089	I'll do my best here a little longer...to deliver this sound of happiness to you.
