001	... ...!
002	Hey. How many days has it been? That red-head is still lying motionless. Do you think he's dead?
003	No. When you get close to him...he keeps muttering things under his breath.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
004	Seriously? Well, if you got close to him then you should have given him something to eat.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
005	Well...there's something disturbing about him.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0047
006	In that case, do you mind if I brought him something?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
007	Huh...?
008	It's been a while...Logi.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0007
009	Huh? Te-teacher? What are you doing here?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
010	Didn't I tell you not to call me teacher? I am still a seeker of knowledge. I'm not in a position to teach. Anyway, I came here to check on Envylia.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0017
011	Envylia? Setsuna...what happened to Envylia?
012	Do you want to know? In that case...	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0031
013	Wh-what...?!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0019
014	Have you forgotten, Logi? When you want to learn something from me...	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0010
015	I must always show you my sword first.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
016	It's because I'm clumsy. When I teach someone something, I must know what they are lacking. That's why–	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
017	But...what I'm lacking has nothing to do with Envylia's current state.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
018	Nothing to do with it? But aren't you a knight of Envylia?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0012
019	...!
020	The future of Envylia should have been carried on the blade of your sword.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0013
021	Y-you're right... It's...it's all my fault!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
022	What you lack what will destroy Envylia's future. That's what fighting is.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0010
023	Prepare yourself...Logi. Right now, you're not worthy of knowing the current state of Envylia.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
024	...!!!
