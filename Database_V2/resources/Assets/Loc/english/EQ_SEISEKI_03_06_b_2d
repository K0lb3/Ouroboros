001	It's finally quiet now.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
002	Seida, tell us what it is that you know.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
003	...All right.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
004	The truth is that we the Alizehan tribe has protected the Sacred Stone over many generations. We were bestowed with that fate...
005	...on the request of Gluttony's government.
006	What?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
007	Didn't you just say that the Alizehan tribe and Gluttony have long been at odds with each other?
008	Yes, I did.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
009	It's true that have a history of adversity towards each other...but, beneath the surface, we reached a compromise long ago.
010	Wait, are you serious? Why?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0021
011	To protect the Sacred Stone, of course.
012	Gluttony's leaders our antagonistic, but they're not idiots.
013	At first, they too attempted to wield the power of the Sacred Stone, but as they continued their research, they realized...
014	Under no circumstances were they to utilize this tremendous power as a weapon, even against their own enemies.
015	However, if the enemy were to become aware of this, they may send their forces to steal the Sacred Stone at any time.
016	That's when they thought up...
017	...the safest place in all the world to hide the Sacred Stone.
018	What?!
019	At first, the leaders of Gluttony came up with the idea of the Alizehan tribe protect it.
020	I mean, nobody would actually believe that they'd hide it amongst their former enemies, would they?	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
021	But as years passed, eventually this information began to leak out.
022	That's when they decided to come up with the next hiding place.
023	Thus, they found the safest place in this entire continent...no, in the entire world...to hide the Sacred Stone.
024	Wh-where...?!
025	Inside the Holy Guard or, more precisely, me.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
026	What?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
027	Since when? Since when have you been keeping it hidden?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0016
028	Of course, from the time I joined.
029	I can't believe it.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
030	How could they place a source of power that could potentially destroy the continent in the hands of someone who was still just a girl...?
031	Seida...I can't even begin to imagine the kind of resolve you must have had in your everyday life.
032	Protecting the Sacred Stone was my tribe's duty as well as our pride.
033	However, our settlement was constantly attacked by those in pursuit of the Stone.
034	My father was killed and the chief, my grandfather, was placed in harm's way countless times.
035	My grandfather was painfully aware that we couldn't protect the Sacred Stone in our tribe any longer.
036	He placed the Stone in my hands and sent me to the safest place in the continent–the Holy Guard.
037	So that's why you joined the Holy Guard.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0045
038	In the Holy Guard, it doesn't matter where your origins are and they don't ask about your past.
039	Also...the Holy Guard is the most powerful knight's order in the entire continent. There is truly no safer place.
040	So that's that. There's no need to worry.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
041	When Waginau figures out that the Sacred Stone isn't inside the ruins. We can take him down together then.
042	... ...
043	All right. Just like you said, Seida, I think that's the best option.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
044	... ...
045	Ah, anyway, Seida...I'll give this back to you.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
046	My...2nd Regiment...coat of arms...
047	Well...how can I put it...I completely grasp the resolve you have towards your mission!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
048	But, if that were the case, how come you didn't tell me sooner?!
049	If you had told me earlier, I wouldn't have said what I said.
050	Seriously. Why don't you try being a little more humble? How about an ‘I was wrong. I am sorry'?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
051	I was wrong...and I...I apologize for my actions.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
052	... ...
053	Seriously...stop apologizing. It's inefficient.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
054	But...th-thank you.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
055	Huh...?! N-no problem.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
056	Heheh. You two finally made up!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
057	All right! Now all that's left is for us to find that Waginau and beat him up!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0038
058	Hm? No? It's not him?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
059	Kagura?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
060	What's the matter, Kagura?! You're covered in wounds. What happened?!
061	Y-you're late...id-idiot.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
062	Kagura!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
