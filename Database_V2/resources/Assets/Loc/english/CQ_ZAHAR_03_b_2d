001	Ve-very impressive, Captain Zahar! This is your best strategy yet!
002	Of course. I've set it up that way.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
003	(Just as I thought, the enemy is headed toward the rear. No one in this battle can break through my defenses...)
004	(Except that man!)
005	Captain Zahar! The squadron protecting the enemy's mainline is headed straight this way!
006	Heh. Just as I expected.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
007	Huzzaahhh!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0007
008	Aim directly for the leaders! If we take them down, then it will change the direction of the battle!
009	(Exactly. In order to pave a path ahead, you have no choice but to defeat me.)
010	(I created this strategy exactly for this purpose!)
011	I've been waiting for you! You, the man who ruined my strategy for the first time!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
012	So it was you then...! This time, let's end this battle properly!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
013	My name is Vettel! I am a proud and honorable knight of Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard!
014	I am Zahar! The Silver-Mane, the one who rules a corner Wratharis!
015	So you are Zahar, who they call the Young Rider of Wratharis?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0026
016	Oh? My name is familiar to you then. Very well, you shall give you last breath here, with that name engraved in your chest!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0044
017	Hyaahhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
018	Arghhhhh!!!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0008
019	... ...
020	... ...
021	What a terrifying battle.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
022	The power of those two are so overwhelming, that it's impossible to get close.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
023	Huff...huff... I've never encountered an enemy so strong!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
024	But I'm still alive... If I'm alive, that means I can take him down!
025	(Why does that man not go down?! I have not gone easy on him!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
026	Do you dare to push me this far you?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
027	It's far from over!!!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0009
028	(No! I can't avoid his blow! I've no choice but to block it!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
029	Heh...heheheh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
030	...?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
031	Not bad, not bad at all! If you were to be the first to ruin my strategy, then it's understandable that you'd be the first to protect yourself from my sword!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
032	(You're almost like a rare artifact I wish to collect. Show me your beautiful form!)
033	Aghhh!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0043
034	Wh-what strength! My sword has become even heavier!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
035	This is not the half of my strength!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0013
036	Ack...right back at you!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
037	(My sword is sharper than usual. Yet, he shows no sign of collapse.)
038	(What is this oddly unpleasant feeling!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
039	Huff...huff... Zahar, I am grateful that I met you here.
040	Grateful?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
041	I would now have been able to experience your limitless strength and the joy of exchange blows, if I had not met you here as enemies.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
042	I see... I understand now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
043	Vettel, withdraw your sword! The victory is mine!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
044	What...!?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0021
045	Look behind you. My soldiers have arrived at your front line.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0015
046	I have no interest in small fry fish. The life of the general you protect has reached its final moments...
047	Because I was holding you back here.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
048	This fate of this battle has already been decided. Take your soldiers and leave.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
049	What?! Do you dare show me compassion?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0012
050	Compassion? I have no need of such emotions. This is just part of my plan.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
051	I'm going to push you to the limit of hopeless until I can hear the sound of despair ringing from you.
052	... ...
053	Let's fall back. Retreat!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
054	Captain Vettel?!
055	There's no point in fighting any further. We will simply end up surrounded and destroyed.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
056	I'll accept the full blame of our retreat. You all bear no responsibility.
057	That's right. This is how it should be. This small stage is not where our final battle will be held.
058	I'll accept your challenge. Good bye, Zahar. However, next time we meet–	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0018
059	That's my line. Away with you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
060	... ...
061	Heheh. Who would've thought that I'd find such a worthy opponent in battle?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
062	(This is another first. This man truly does keep me on the edge!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
063	The next time we meet, I will be the one to destroy you, Vettel!
