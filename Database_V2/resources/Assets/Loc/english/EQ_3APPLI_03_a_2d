001	We've defeated them! Let's hurry before that thing spreads!
002	Whoa! What is this black thing?! It's wrapping around my body!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0043
003	Ack... My power is being drained.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_battle_0019
004	I...will...eat...you.
005	Who are you?!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0027
006	I...will...eat...every...part...of...you!
007	Aghhhhhh! It's entering inside me!!!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0028
008	What's the matter, Yomi?! Hurry! Run!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
009	No! We need to save him or he'll be devoured.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0021
010	Yomi! I'm going to save you! Give me your hand!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0018
011	 
012	Aghhh! Sakura!!!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0043
013	All right, I got you. Let's run!	VO_sakura.sakura_battle_0019
014	We can't see the mist anymore.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
015	It's troublesome. Who knows where or when it'll appear next.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0031
016	Uff...	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0022
017	Yomi? Are you okay?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0001
018	Huh? What happened?	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0025
019	Are you serious? You were just shouting your head off after you got caught up in that black thing.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
020	What are you talking about? What black thing?	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0026
021	Huh? You don't remember?
022	Hey! Yomi, hang in there!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0014
023	Huh?
024	What's going on?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0021
025	Maybe this is with Rena meant when she said it'll eat your memories?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
026	What?! It ate her memories?! Hey, Yomi! Do you know who I am?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
027	Um...Sakura?	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0031
028	Phew... What a relief. I just didn't want to be forgotten.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
029	Since the mist barely touched her, it looks like she's only lost her most recent memories.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
030	But...why were those monsters were appearing from inside that mist?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0031
031	That thing is supposed to be something that eats things. My memory is somehow frayed. There must be something that I can't remember.
032	Losing your memories is forgetting your own existence. It's a very sad thing.
033	Hey...you.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0031
034	Huh? Me? What is it?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
035	You remind me of someone. Who was it again? Umm...	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0031
036	Yomi, what's up with you? One moment you're spacing out and the next you're saying something bizarre... Are you really okay?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
037	Oh! That's right! I remember! You remind me of the old hag!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0024
038	The old...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
039	Yes, of course! The old hag, the old hag! You look like the old hag! Don't you think so, Sakura?	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0008
040	Now that you mention it, you might it be right...	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0022
041	Huh? D-do I look that old?!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
042	No, no! That's not what I meant.
043	You remind me of when the old hag was young! Sorry for surprising you! Ahahah.
044	When she was young...? I'm relieved.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0007
045	Hey, Yomi, stop saying straight things!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0012
046	Well, I suddenly remembered this!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0016
047	Memories are a strange thing. You forget one thing and remember another.
048	That being said, an opponent who eats memories is a frightening one.,	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
049	If we fight it again and eats our memories...will we even be able to fight?
050	I have an idea! Let's take a photograph now, just in case it eats our memories.
051	It's too dangerous not knowing who our opponents and allies are on the battlefield.
052	A photograph? That might be a good idea!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
053	But how are we going to take it? It's not like we have a camera.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
054	Don't worry. I have my smartphone with me.
055	Smart...phone? What's that?
056	A smartphone is a device that you can use to, amongst other things, make calls and take photos.
057	Amazing! You can take photos with something this thin?! If only Slothstein had this kind of technology!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0046
058	Um... What is a photo?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
059	Huh, what's going on? What are you gonna take?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
060	The black mist...the one who gives birth to it...with its thoughts... I think I'm about to remember something.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0043
061	Everyone, get close. You too, Rena.
062	Huh, what? Now isn't the time for this.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0025
063	All right, here goes. Say ‘cheese'!
064	Umm... What did you say about cheese?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
065	What?! Did you just take something?! Wait, is that some kind of ability to steal youth?! I'm gonna become like the old hag!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
066	Hey, Chloe! Am I all wrinkled up?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0019
067	Don't worry. You're still young, Sakura.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
068	What a relief.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
069	He-hey... I was just about to remember something.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
070	What's that black thing?!
071	Again?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0016
072	It's approaching from inside again! Inside...that...I remember!	VO_rena.rena_battle_0022
073	There are so many of them!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
074	Let quickly defeat it and run!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
