001	What's on your mind, Seida?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
002	Well... I just think we shouldn't underestimate that Spica girl.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
003	What do you mean?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
004	She disappeared without a trace in such little time.
005	She might have possibly received some kind of special training.
006	Tsk, this is so troublesome.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
007	It's Kanon's fault in the first place to be carelessly taking along this completely random character.
008	She lacks the required self-awareness of a Lord Commander.
009	The required self-awareness of a Lord Commander? Captain Monzein, do you understand how much mental energy it takes to be the Lord Commander?
010	Huh? Well... I've never been the Lord Commander myself though, so...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
011	Kanon is just the same. She was assigned as the next Lord Commander so suddenly.
012	It's not like the self-awareness as a Lord Commander suddenly appears out of nowhere. So do you think it's reasonable for the captains to expect her to be perfect?
013	W-well... i-it's not like I expect her to be perfect...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
014	Then isn't it perfectly natural that she lacks that self-awareness you're talking about?!
015	But it's still an undisputable fact that Kanon, a young girl with little experience, got assigned as the next Lord Commander!
016	But even so, all you do is complain! What do you expect will happen if we don't support her?!
017	Ugh...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
018	Geez, how inflexible can you be?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
019	As a former member of your regiment, I would really like you to act like a proper captain!
020	Huh?! What did I do or say that was inflexible?!
021	Aren't you aware of that?! Don't you know what your regiment members are calling you behind your back?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
022	What they're calling me? I know they do call me “The Great Thunder Axe...”	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
023	Geez... it's a bit embarrassing, so I always tell them to shut up.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0011
024	No. Behind your back, they go on calling you “the foolish boar.”	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
025	T-t-the foolish boar?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
026	You've been making a fool of yourself with your stubborn and reckless behavior. It's sad for me to see as well.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
027	W-who?! Who are the ones who called me that?! Bring them all here!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0010
028	How could I possibly even do that? Please stop saying such unreasonable things!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0015
029	Grrrr! How could they make a fool out of their captain?! It's going to... it's going to disrupt the order!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
030	Anyway, it's our duty as captains to give our support to Kanon!
031	Please just engrave that in your mind!<br>Do you understand?
032	Ughh...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
033	Wow! I wouldn't have imagined such a cave beneath Ramproad Mountain!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
034	If we wouldn't have known about that tiny entrance, we would have never noticed! We really need to thank Seida.
035	We've been walking for quite a while though, and we haven't seen any people, let alone a blacksmithing forge. Is this really the right place?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
036	Wait!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
037	Huh?
038	Look there! That looks like some kind of monument! The fact that there's something here created by humans...
039	...Must mean that the forge could be near!
040	Right. Let's investigate. We may find a hint that indicates the location of the forge.
041	Okay!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
042	It doesn't actually look that old...<br>Huh?!
043	What's the matter, Chloe?
044	Wait a second, Kanon!<br>This monument... it has Yogi Ku's name engraved in it!
045	Huh?!<br>Could it be... Yogi Ku's grave?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
046	Could it be that the reason why Seida said we may not be able to get Excalibur restored...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0021
047	...be because Yogi Ku has already passed away?!
048	Huh... but Yogi Ku is the only person who could possibly restore Excalibur!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
049	Are you serious?!<br>If that's true, Excalibur may never...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
050	I can hear Excalibur calling. It seems that the stories of Zain being killed were true.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
051	?!
052	I never expected a little kid like you showing up with it though!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
053	U-umm... who are you?
054	Be quiet! You bunch of degraded knight who disgrace the name of the Holy Guard!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0012
055	Let me bestow punishment upon you in Zain's stead!
056	Huh?
057	Shining Flare!!!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0014
058	?!<br>D-dodge, Chloe!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
059	Ugh!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
060	Tsk...<br>Pretty swift aren't you!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
061	H-hey, wait a second!<br>How did you just...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
062	Hm?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
063	That ability just now, that was Lord Zain's ability! How could she know it?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
064	You're not getting away from here! Feel your regrets as you perish!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0043
