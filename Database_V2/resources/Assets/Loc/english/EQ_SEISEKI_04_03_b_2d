001	Hyaaah!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0001
002	Whoa! There's still so many! There's no end to them!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0025
003	It can't be helped. Let's take them out all at once. Kagutsuchi!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0014
004	Phew... We finally got rid of them all.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
005	... ...
006	Can you please explain properly this time, Lord Zain? What is going on?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
007	I...
008	The sword I have is called Excalibur.
009	I know. It's a holy sword that has been passed down from generation to generation of Lord Commanders.
010	Yes. Do you know why it has been passed down? Why it's been this Excalibur instead of other swords?	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
011	Huh?
012	Long ago, Nimul and Emmel, the alleged founders of Alchemy, shattered the Grand Excelsior.
013	After doing so, they used the very same raw materials to create another sword–Excalibur.
014	The Grand Excelsior that was shattered by Nimul and Emmel...
015	...became the 7 Sacred Stones that bring balance to this world.
016	However, this balance will not last forever. If one of the Sacred Stones is exploited, it would cause the entire equilibrium to collapse.
017	The Excalibur was originally handed to the Lord Commander long ago as a way of destroying the Sacred Stone if such a thing were to happen.
018	What are you talking about? What does that have to do with the fact that you just summoned a bunch of monsters?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
019	That was to observe your abilities.
020	What...?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
021	Even if the source of the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi is different than the 7 Sacred Stones, it has similar properties.
022	Kagura...your country, Wadatsumi, has an artifact similar to that of Excalibur.
023	Y-you're not talking about the Kagutsuchi, are you?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
024	Exactly.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
025	The secret art of Kagutsuchi–passed down for generations within the royal family of Wadatsumi–was most likely created with the aim of destroying the Mikaboshi.
026	This is just a theory, but it is quite plausible. We have found several such mentions in old literature.
027	When you say it like that...that technique was originally not to destroy goblins with.
028	Could it be for when the Mikaboshi goes berserk?!
029	Yes...because of that it was necessary to immediately check your Kagutsuchi.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
030	Our conclusion was that your Kagutsuchi cannot destroy the Mikaboshi.
031	What...?!
032	Seeing you battle just now, I understand that your technique is incomplete.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
033	...?!
