001	Wow, Liz! That monster looked incredibly strong!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0024
002	I think I'm getting a hang of using this power.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
003	I won't lose.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0012
004	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
005	I won't allow there to be something that you can do that I can't!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
006	Hey...Rebecca?! Don't you remember how you messed up with that mindset before?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0047
007	Shut up! If an inferior student like her can gain that power, then I must as well!
008	That's the absolute destiny of a witch born from the family of Helkovara!
009	Wh-what are you trying to do?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
010	Right. Liz, didn't you oversleep the other day? Hey, whoa!
011	Agh! Are the monsters increasing?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
012	They're not opponents. You're not the only who can summon pawns.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
013	I have the ability to summon the soul of a monster who has remained dormant in an ancient fossil.
014	This is Battalion–the ultimate magic passed down within the Helkovara family!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_0021
015	Lisbeth, your services are no longer required.
016	From here, I, Rebecca Helkovara Lustburg alone will destroy the monsters!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_0001
017	Hey, don't be so selfish! My grades are on the line as well! Let's go, Alma.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
018	Aren't you two getting a little too heated up?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0049
