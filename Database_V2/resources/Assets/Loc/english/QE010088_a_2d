001	Please retret, Captain Zeke! This guy's power is overwhelming!
002	Sabareta, what you are trying to do will lead the world to ruin!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0016
003	Do you understand that?!
004	Hmph. I throw those words right back in your face.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
005	I know the truth that you are trying to hide—what you have erased from history.
006	What? What are you talking about?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
007	Don't play the fool. I'm talking about your daughter Agatha's origin.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
008	You...!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0020
009	Just as I thought. Your agitation is enough of an answer.
010	I will not allow you to do with the Wratharis royal lineage as you please!
011	No...!
012	You...!
013	Are you all right, dad?!
014	Logi! Agatha...!
015	Heheh. It appears all the players are present.
016	Wait, Sabareta! There's something I want to discuss with you!
017	Please! We want to fulfill the "promise" we discussed before!
018	Your absurd ideals again? With both our swords unsheathed, it's a little too late for discussions.
019	They are not ideals!
020	I told you... We should be able to make it a reality as long as we don't give up!
021	Then, turn it into a reality; convince me with the use of force!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
022	...!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
