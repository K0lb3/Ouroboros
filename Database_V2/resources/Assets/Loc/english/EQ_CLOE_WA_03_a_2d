001	The knights from my squadron looked uneasy today as well.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
002	I guess the rumors are true. They feel anxious under the command of a woman.
003	I still lack in strength. I know that. I need to be stronger than any other commander. I need to have the strength befitting a commander.
004	In my current position, I can't call myself an effective commander yet!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0016
005	I need to train more and become stronger!
006	Ack. I couldn't cut it down.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
007	Hm? No... My sword is stuck.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
008	Hmf! Come out!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0024
009	Eeek!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0027
010	Ouch...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
011	...!
012	A golem?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
013	...!
014	Are you angry?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
015	!!!
016	Oh. Are you protecting the little golem? I'm sorry. You were hiding behind that crystal cluster.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0035
017	... ...
018	You've got such a small body, but you're doing everything you can to protect the little golem.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0046
019	That being said, what a beautiful crystal. You've got a lovely house.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0008
020	...
021	Oh, it ran away.
022	It really is a beautiful crystal though. Heheh. It reminds me of the glass Captain Vettel gave me.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
023	That was the time Captain Vettel encouraged me...oh! 	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
024	As someone who leads a squadron, your aim is to return safely with all your knights alive.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
025	... ...
026	I really am still lacking as a commander. I can't believe I forget something so important.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0021
027	My most important task as a leader is to safely bring everyone back from the battlefield. And to protect everyone if necessary.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
028	Even the small, vulnerable golems risk their own lives to protect their friends.
029	Using myself a shield to protect everyone is something I can do. No, wait. It's what I always thought to do.
030	Why did I forget about that?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
031	Oh, I'm such an idiot! A stupid, stupid idiot!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0025
032	Golem, Captain Vettel, thank you for reminding me.
033	Yes. I'll become everyone's shield. I'll hone that style of fighting!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
