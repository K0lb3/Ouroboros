001	Agh! Retreat! Retreat!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0022
002	Ah. They're leaving in quite an extravagant fashion.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0044
003	Are they...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0001
004	They're from Gluttony Foss. Most likely, they were attempting to capture me.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
005	Well, as a compromise you could live in the village near the forest–
006	More importantly, are your injuries okay?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
007	Huh? Oh, ouch!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0042
008	Honestly. You're such a troublesome... Come on. We're going home. I need to look after your injuries.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0007
009	... ...
010	What's the matter?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0004
011	My voice reached the animals.
012	...I see.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
013	Did you figure out why the beasts didn't respond to you?
014	Yes. I'm sure what the animals wanted to say was this:	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
015	Don't forget.
016	That even if it's not there anymore, as long as I remember the forest, it will not disappear.
017	Do you need me to guide you outside of the forest?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
018	No. I'm okay. Thanks to you, I'm all right now.
019	I see.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0006
020	Come to Lustburg some day. It's really a lovely city. Next time, I'll show you around.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0049
021	No, I'd rather not.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
022	A stubborn person like me is much better suited for the forest than amongst flocks of people.
023	...I see.
024	Of course, there's also the option of you staying in the forest and living here.
025	I can't do that. If I stay here, I'm sure I'll continue to rely on you.
026	I can't call myself your friend if I'm relying on and clinging to you.
027	You might be right.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
028	Then this is where we part ways. Farewell.
029	Yes. You too, Peridot! I'll visit you again!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
030	Right. I'll be here in this forest, waiting until that day.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
031	Goodbye, Peridot!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
032	Goodbye, Flamel. Have a good journey.
033	...
034	...I know.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
035	The two of us will never meet again. He will die in his city in the way he so desires.
036	I will also live in the place that I desire...and live in the way that I desire.
037	I will wait, wait, and continue to wait. And if I get tired of waiting, well...going on a journey might not be a bad idea.
