001	Tsk... No good. This one's already croaked as well.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
002	Well, the Alkaroids are made by the Beckrams. I doubt they'd give up information so easily.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
003	...What are you doing, Al?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
004	Squeak... Hacking...	VO_alkemono.alkemono_skill_0001
005	Hacking?
006	Aye, I'm decoding the data of the non-functioning Alkaroid.
007	...It's no good. It hasn't been informed of any important information.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0016
008	So you can retrieve information from a non-functioning Alkaroid?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
009	Aye, of course.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0012
010	Don't make fun of an Alkemono! Sometimes it even works!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
011	So you somehow peek into the memories left in their head?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
012	Even if it's not active, I can decode the information inside sometimes.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
013	Scrap Mountain...
014	Scrap Mountain?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
015	There's a place that collects broken or unused Alkaroids!
016	In other words, it's a treasure trove of information! Edgar!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
017	Not a bad idea, Ronnie. Do you know where this Scrap Mountain...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
018	Who do you think you're asking? I know every nook and cranny in Redington City.
019	Heh. It looks that new possibility just opened up for us. Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
