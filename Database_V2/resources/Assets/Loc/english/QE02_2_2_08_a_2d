001	Oh! It's that! On the map, that construction site is the planned toll gate for the highway.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
002	Let's go! Hold on tight!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
003	Squeak! Guard Droid detected! Guard Droid detected! There are security Guard Droids inside the construction site.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
004	Sorry to deprive you of your job, but we've already taken them out. Is that all of them?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
005	There are still several near the gate, aye! And...
006	A pack of Hounds is closing in from behind, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
007	That no-good Alkaroid is with them as well. It's my chance to avenge Ejitan, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0012
008	Sorry, but revenge will have to wait for later. We can't waste the information that Ejitan sacrificed his life to obtain. 	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
009	For Ejitan's sake as well, we must do whatever we can to reach that train.
010	I know that, aye! That's the best way to honor his memory!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0011
011	Exactly.
012	It's coming into view! There's the gate that connects to the underground highway!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
013	All right! Let's ride this through. Hold on tight!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
