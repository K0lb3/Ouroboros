001	Everything good?
002	Aye. Still alive, at least… We'll manage.
003	…Traveller.
004	Huh? Me?
005	I am Soren, Speaker for the Divine Protector of this village.
006	(He's… only a child.)
007	The villagers rely on me to channel their prayers to the Divine Protector, who watches over our settlement.
008	In return, we must offer life essence - blood - to allow his continued manifestation in the physical form.
009	This is what we must do each year, to revitalize his physical vessel after his toils in this mortal world.
010	Hmm, I see.
011	(This sounds a lot like the extraction of Alchemia. Well, at least they aren't sacrificing anyone…)
012	(How did this kid manage to distill Alchemia particles from blood in this place? Most practictioners spend more energy on this method than they can get out of this…)
013	Is something wrong, traveller?
014	…No. And I apologize for not introducing myself. I am Siegfried.
015	I have heard of you from the elder. Thank you for helping to protect the village in our time of need.
016	No problem. You'd best stay back, though - I see more of them coming.
017	(Just what do these raiders want? I have a bad feeling about this.)
