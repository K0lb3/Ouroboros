001	Y-you're strong!<br>I can't believe you were concealing such power!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
002	Is that all you have? Do you really think you can carry Excalibur with such mediocrity?	VO_spica.spica_battle_0017
003	I suppose Lord Zahar could have truly been the righteous inheritor of Excalibur.
004	Ugh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
005	You're wondering about Monzein and Seida?
006	Both of them died in vain, putting their lives on the line for your sake.
007	What?!<br>Seida and Captain Monzein are dead?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
008	Yes. They were getting in my way, so I eliminated them.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
009	...!
010	With your degree of power...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
011	you could not save Kagura and your comrades, let alone the people of this world.
012	I will take Excalibur from you.
013	No, I will show you that I can save everyone! Kagura, my dear comrades, and all suffering people in the world!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
014	What makes you believe that you can actually say that?
015	Lord Zain's, Captain Cadanova's, and many of my comrades' hopes are on this sword!
016	I am supported by all of their wishes.<br>I will not hesitate any longer!
017	Do you mean to say you can open a path into the future with sheer willpower?
018	I do! After all, that is my strongest weapon! I won't run away any longer!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
019	Double Edged Execution!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0011
020	Alchemia Nova!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
021	Ughh!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0027
022	I-is this your true power, the power that stopped Lord Zahar?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0042
023	I'm sorry. Since everybody's hopes are resting on my shoulders, I cannot allow myself to lose.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0017
024	I-I'm happy that I got to talk to you.<br>Now... please finish me.
025	Excalibur is meant for saving people.
026	It's not meant for meaninglessly hurting people.
027	Huh?!<br>W-what do you mean?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
028	That should be my question to you. Why don't I feel any intention to kill in your attacks?
029	...!
030	You will never be able to turn yourself in a true avenger.
031	Also, you didn't truly kill Seida and Captain Monzein, did you?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
032	Could you please explain me your reasons for that?
033	This whole time, I've been serving Lord Zahar, whom I greatly adore.
034	Right.
035	There was something I noticed by always being by his side.
036	I noticed that his ambitions grew more inflated by the day.
037	And little by little, his heart became absorbed by the darkness.
038	...
039	But I wasn't able to stop Lord Zahar when he chose the wrong path.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
040	My words could not reach him.<br>And then, that day came...
041	You mean, the day that we stood against Zahar?
042	Right. Of course, that's where he lost his life. Part of me did feel like holding grudges.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
043	But more significantly, I felt gratitude towards you two.
044	Huh? Gratitude?
045	I always continued adoring Lord Zahar, and I didn't want to see his further deterioration.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
046	You two fulfilled that earnest wish of mine.
047	...
048	And that really made me feel like getting to know you two.
049	I started wondering what could be the difference between us, since you two had been able to stop Lord Zahar where I couldn't.
050	But... I feel like standing against you in battle like this made me understand.
051	Huh?
052	I feel like you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering.
053	With the help of Excalibur, you should be able to save people like Lord Zahar, who chose the wrong path.
054	You are truly the one who should wield the Holy Sword Excalibur.
055	Spica...
056	Huh?!<br>T-the earth is still trembling?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
057	Kanon! This is really bad! Take Chloe with you and evacuate yourselves!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
058	Huh?!
059	The dark energies from Guren Blade have triggered the volcano!
060	Ramproad Mountain's fault line started moving, in desire for the dark energies!
061	It wouldn't be too strange if the mountain started spewing magma any time soon, so hurry up!!!
062	D-do you mean it could be erupting?! If a huge mountain like this were to erupt...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
063	We don't have time to think about consequences! Just get yourselves out of here for now!!!
064	This mountain's fault line started moving in desire for the dark energies?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
065	Yes, probably!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
066	It is said that when my ancestors originally crafted Guren Blade, it also caused the volcano to erupt in desire for the dark energies!
067	So... would that mean that this fault line could possibly calm back down again after sending down large amounts of dark energy into them?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
068	Theoretically, I guess.<br>But we really don't have time to be standing about here, so get yourself out of here already!!!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
069	No... it's probably going to be okay.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
070	Huh?
071	Let us go, Lord Zahar.
072	Spica?
073	Kanon, I would really like you to turn your ideals into reality.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
074	Huh?
075	Spica?!<br>Don't tell me you're heading towards the crater!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
076	Stop! Don't go with her!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0014
077	But...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
078	Have you forgotten already?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0017
079	The future of the world is resting on your shoulders! If you were to die here, who could possibly lead the world?!
080	Ugh! B-but...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
081	Kanon! I'm sure you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering!
082	Please use your powers to build a world where people don't get lost in sorrow like I did!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0041
083	Whoaaaaaaa!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
084	Spica!!!
085	Uhh!<br>Whah?!
086	Huh? The trembling seems to be calming down! Could she have truly calmed down the fault line?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0021
087	Spica!
088	Geez, Zahar must have had massive amounts of dark energy.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
089	Seida?!
090	I'm sorry, we got a little held up.<br>I know it's really unreasonable.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
091	Seida, please!<br>Please save Spica!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
092	Huh?
093	Spica headed towards the crater to stop the volcano from erupting!
094	Are you seriously asking us to do such an unreasonable thing?	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
095	I suppose the volcano is happy enough with Zahar's malicious soul alone.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
096	Huh?
097	Oh man, that was hot. I was about to get caught into the magma with this one.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
098	Spica!!!
099	Oh my, that lady sure has a way of escaping danger. And you too, for that matter.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
100	Phuh! Well, I never thought the day would come that I'd be saving a follower of Zahar. However...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
101	Huh?
102	Seeing the chivalry in this fellow knight who was considering the fate of the world, I couldn't possibly let her go to waste!
103	Isn't that right, Lord Commander?
104	...Right!!!
105	So... is Spica alright?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
106	Don't worry, she merely lost consciousness. I put her to rest along with Chloe inside the sanctuary.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
107	Thank goodness.<br>Thank you, Seida.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
108	More importantly...<br>I just hope we're not too late.
109	Hey, please don't say such an ill omened thing!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
110	Don't worry.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
111	This is the first chance for the new Excalibur to prove its worth. Put your spirit into it!
112	Yes!
113	Excalibur, please bring Kagura back to us safely!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
114	...Kaguraaa!!!
115	Huh...?
116	T-there's some kind of shape...
117	Hey... are you sure you didn't mess up the way you cut it?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0016
118	Uh...<br>K-Kanon...?
119	Kagura!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
120	Oh... right... I got trapped into Captain Othima's Philosopher's Stone in Wadatsumi...
121	A-are you really Kagura?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0021
122	Captain Monzein...<br>Why are you staring at me like that?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0031
123	W-well, it's just...<br>I guess... you've grown up quite a bit.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
124	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
125	...You foolish boar.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
126	Hmm... Hey, what about Lord Zain? I remember that Kudanstein came...
127	...!<br>Oh, right...
128	Well... a lot happened while you were sleeping. We'll have plenty of time to fill you in later.
129	Okay...<br>Yawnnn... Sorry...<br>I feel like sleeping just a little longer.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
130	Anyway, we did it!!!<br>Miuna, thank you so much!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
131	What are you talking about?<br>You have only yourself to thank for all of this.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
132	Ahaha...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
133	Well... I suppose we could take a breath of relief for now.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
134	Right! It would be wonderful it the other captains also returned to us now though...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
135	At this point, I suppose I could tell you...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
136	Hm?
137	I don't know about Captain Kudanstein, but... Captain Yauras and Captain Othima never left the Holy Guard, you know?
138	They're just investigating Greed Dike right now.
139	Huh?!<br>Are you serious?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
140	I didn't say anything until now, because I didn't want to distract you from Excalibur.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
141	Both of them are still acting for the sake of the Holy Guard, just like before.
142	R-really?!<br>Thank goodness!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
143	H-hey, wait a second!<br>I never heard about that either!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
144	You wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face in front of Kanon, would you?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
145	So I thought it was reasonable to just keep it secret altogether.
146	Tsk...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
147	I see! I'm relieved!<br>Thank you, Seida!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
148	You don't seem too surprised though.
149	Well... that's because I always kept believing in them.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
150	Hehe... I see.<br>Well, why don't we head back then... Lord Commander?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0023
151	...Right!
152	U-urghhh...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
153	Chloe!<br>Are you okay?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
154	Y-yeah...<br>Well... I noticed Spica sleeping next to me though...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
155	Oh...
156	D-does this mean...<br>that everything turned out well?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
157	Yes! Look, we even managed to get Kagura back unscathed!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
158	She does look a little different though.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
159	I see... thank goodness.<br>H-hey, could I just make one request?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
160	What would that be?
161	Well... Would you mind informing Lord Vettel about my involvements here?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
162	Geez, Chloe...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
163	Many truths were whispered into my ear, and many truths met a pitiful end.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
164	Among all these waves of truth, flowing like a big river, that one man's face stood out above all else.
165	His words caught my attention more than anything else!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
166	I need to confirm these truths he spoke of with my own eyes!
